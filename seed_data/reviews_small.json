There's a treasure, a beautiful woman, and an evil man of the cloth. Berry's novel differs a bit from some others in that he spends more time on background history, character backstory, etc (which some might see as a negative). A big difference -- and a plus, in my opinion -- is the explanation at the end of the novel regarding what parts of the story are partially or wholly based in fact and what parts are made up. Berry gives names of scholars and titles of works cited (none of which is \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\"). \"The Templar Legacy\" is a bit slower moving than some other adventure tales, but it is a good read for those interested in arcane church history (which must be a pretty big audience the way these books are selling!)", "summary": "Seeking truth in fiction?", "unixReviewTime": 1145232000}

There are no self-assessment tests to ensure that your kids are prepared to go onwards.  All in all, the major weakness of this curriculum is that it requires a high degree of teaching skill to implement successfully, as there is very little curriculum theory in the book.\n\nour kids can decode but what's really the problem is that they lack their own motivation to decode and read.  they will occasionally read things and try to spell things on their own, but they don't have the motivation to pick up an early reader book and get through the entire book, on their own, yet.  i do not think we are \"pushing\" our kids so much, as they just don't have the right stuff (and we don't have the time to design something from scratch) that makes reading \"fun\".\n\nOur twin boys just turned 4 years old.  disclaimer: both parents are engineers, one with a ph.d.", "summary": "Good up to a point, but ...", "unixReviewTime": 1138147200}

Why was this one given the Pulitzer prize?\n\nThe blurb for this book claims that it  represents a new interpretation of the revolutionary generation, reconceived as \"Founding Brothers\" rather than Founding Fathers.  But this is not borne out by the book, which reads like a collection of journal articles on miscellaneous subjects, rather than a unified thematic work.\n\nEllis's other books had a friendly, intelligent, companionable quality which kept me reading.  I looked forward to picking up the story where I left off.  In fact sometimes I even found it hard to stop reading, so gripping was the narrative and so new were the insights I was gaining into the emblematic names of the American pantheon.  But in reading this book I have been frequently bored.  The fact that each chapter stands on its own actually makes them harder to read - the chapters do not build on one another, yet sometimes they are redundant (and redundancy with Ellis's other books is frequent) - and chronological weirdness abounds - events treated in the first chapter took place many years AFTER the events in the second chapter, etc.\n\nI wonder if Ellis was trying to be \"postmodern\" with this book - a big temptation for him I'm sure, since he is a good writer, well in command of his material, and surrounded on all sides by professional colleagues who value style and eccentricity over content.\n\nI don't want to say that the book is not worth reading, but I would certainly place it last on the list among Ellis's excellent and justly celebrated works.", "summary": "I expected better", "unixReviewTime": 1137974400}
