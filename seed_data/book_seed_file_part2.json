{"title": "1Q84 : Books 1 and 2", "authors": ["Haruki Murakami"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2012-08-01", "description": "Haruki Murakami is an international phenomenon. When Books One and Two of his latest masterpiece, 1Q84, were published in Japan, a million copies were sold in one month, and the critical acclaim that ensued was reported all over the globe. Readers were transfixed by the mesmerising story of Aomame and Tengo and the strange parallel universe they inhabit. Then, one year later, to the surprise and delight of his readers, Murakami published an unexpected Book Three, bringing the story to a close. In order to reflect the experience of 1Q84's first readers, Harvill Secker is publishing Books One and Two in one beautifully designed volume and Book Three in a separate edition. A long-awaited treat for his fans, 1Q84 is also a thrilling introduction to the unique world of Murakami's imagination. This hypnotically addictive novel is a work of startling originality and, as the title suggests, a mind-bending ode to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. (The number 9 in Japanese is pronounced like the letter 'Q'). The year is 1984. Aomame sits in a taxi on the expressway in Tokyo. Her work is not the kind which can be discussed in public but she is in a hurry to carry out an assignment and, with the traffic at a stand-still, the driver proposes a solution. She agrees, but as a result of her actions starts to feel increasingly detached from the real world. She has been on a top-secret mission, and her next job will lead her to encounter the apparently superhuman founder of a religious cult. Meanwhile, Tengo is leading a nondescript life but wishes to become a writer. He inadvertently becomes involved in a strange affair surrounding a literary prize to which a mysterious seventeen-year-old girl has submitted her remarkable first novel. It seems to be based on her own experiences and moves readers in unusual ways. Can her story really be true? Both Aomame and Tengo notice that the world has grown strange; both realise that they are indispensable to each other. While their stories influence one another, at times by accident and at times intentionally, the two come closer and closer to intertwining. ** Murakami\u00e2e(tm)s new novel is coming ** COLORLESS TSUKURU TAZAKI AND HIS YEARS OF PILGRIMAGE 'The reason why death had such a hold on Tsukuru Tazaki was clear.

Meanwhile across the Atlantic, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish Catholic teenager, is nervously anticipating the changes that are sure to come since Germany has declared war on Poland. As tensions rise abroad - and in her personal life - Caroline's interest in aiding the war effort in France grows and she eventually learns about the dire situation at the Ravensbruck all-female concentration camp. At the same time, Kasia's carefree youth is quickly slipping away, only to be replaced by a fervor for the Polish resistance movement. Through Ravensbruck - and the horrific atrocities taking place there told in part by an infamous German surgeon, Herta Oberheuser - the two women's lives will converge in unprecedented ways and a novel of redemption and hope emerges that is breathtaking in scope and depth. From New York to Paris, and Furstenberg to Lublin, Martha Hall Kelly captures the powerful pull of human compassion, strong enough to stretch across continents and capable of triumphing over the grim evils of war. This is a striking story of an unsung heroine and her resolute will to right what is wrong.

Bryson documents the efforts of earlier scholars, from today's most respected academics to eccentrics like Delia Bacon, an American who developed a firm but unsubstantiated conviction that her namesake, Francis Bacon, was the true author of Shakespeare's plays. Emulating the style of his famous travelogues, Bryson records episodes in his research, including a visit to a bunkerlike room in Washington, D.C., where the world's largest collection of First Folios is housed. Bryson celebrates Shakespeare as a writer of unimaginable talent and enormous inventiveness, a coiner of phrases (\"vanish into thin air,\" \"foregone conclusion,\" \"one fell swoop\") that even today have common currency.

When the woman is approached by the border police as her train is leaving Italy, she makes a run for it and is killed as she crosses the tracks in front of an oncoming train. She has a considerable sum of money on her and her papers are obvious forgeries. Case closed. But when the old woman's neighbour returns from a business trip in London, it becomes clear that the maid could not have had time to kill the old woman before catching her train, and that the money on her was not stolen. Commissario Brunetti decides - unofficially - to take the case on himself.

It was a Wednesday, early in September 1952. The Cardinals were five games behind the Dodgers with two weeks to go, and the season looked hopeless. The cotton, however, was waist high to my father, almost over my head, and he and my grandfather could be heard before supper whispering words that were seldom heard. It could be a \"good crop.\" Thus begins the new novel from John Grisham, a story inspired by his own childhood in rural Arkansas. The narrator is a seven year old farm boy named Luke Chandler, who lives in the cotton fields with his parents and grandparents in a little house that's never been painted. The Chandlers farm eighty acres that they rent, not own, and when the cotton is ready they hire a truckload of Mexicans and a family from the Ozarks to help harvest it. For six weeks they pick cotton, battling the heat, the rain, the fatigue, and sometimes, each other. As the weeks pass Luke sees and hears things no seven year old could possibly be prepared for, and finds himself keeping secrets that not only threaten the crop but will change the lives of the Chandlers forever. A Painted House is a moving story of one boy's journey from innocence to experience.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780099416159"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0099416158"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 466, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Arkansas"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 65, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.253.4.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iTGx-wkaY5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iTGx-wkaY5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=iTGx-wkaY5gC&dq=isbn:0099416158&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=iTGx-wkaY5gC&dq=isbn:0099416158&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Painted_House.html?hl=&id=iTGx-wkaY5gC", "isbn": "0099416158"}

{"title": "The Peter Principle", "subtitle": "Why Things Always Go Wrong", "authors": ["Laurence J. Peter", "Raymond Hull"], "publisher": "HarperBusiness", "publishedDate": "2009-04-14", "description": "This book caused a storm when first published in 1969, battering up the bestseller list to #1, charming readers from Topeka to Timbuktu, and finally, brilliantly, blessedly giving the world an answer to a question that nags us all: Why is incompetence so maddeningly rampant and so vexingly triumphant? The book and the phrase it defined are now considered comedic-yet-classic cornerstones of organizational thought, and in honor of the book's fortieth anniversary, Robert I. Sutton has written a foreword introducing the book to a new generation of readers. The Peter Principle, the eponymous law Laurence Peter coined, explains that \"in a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.\" Everyone\u2014from the office intern to the CEO, from the low-level civil servant to a nation's president\u2014will inevitably rise to his or her level of incompetence, if it hasn't happened already. Dr. Peter's glorious revelation explains why incompetence is at the root of everything we endeavor to do\u2014why schools bestow ignorance, why governments condone anarchy, why courts dispense injustice, why prosperity causes unhappiness, and why utopian plans never generate utopias. With the wit of James Thurber or Mark Twain, the psychological and anthropological acuity of Sigmund Freud or Margaret Mead, and the theoretical impact of Isaac Newton or Copernicus, Dr. Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull's brilliant book explains how incompetence and its accompanying symptoms, syndromes, and remedies define the world and the work we do in it.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061699063"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061699061"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 10, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DfnkwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DfnkwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=DfnkwAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061699063&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=DfnkwAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061699063&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Peter_Principle.html?hl=&id=DfnkwAEACAAJ", "isbn": "0061699063"}

{"title": "The Happiness Project", "subtitle": "Or, Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun", "authors": ["Gretchen Rubin"], "publisher": "Harper Collins", "publishedDate": "2009-12-29", "description": "Gretchen Rubin had an epiphany one rainy afternoon in the unlikeliest of places: a city bus. \"The days are long, but the years are short,\" she realized. \"Time is passing, and I'm not focusing enough on the things that really matter.\" In that moment, she decided to dedicate a year to her happiness project. In this lively and compelling account of that year, Rubin carves out her place alongside the authors of bestselling memoirs such as Julie and Julia, The Year of Living Biblically, and Eat, Pray, Love. With humor and insight, she chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Rubin didn't have the option to uproot herself, nor did she really want to; instead she focused on improving her life as it was. Each month she tackled a new set of resolutions: give proofs of love, ask for help, find more fun, keep a gratitude notebook, forget about results. She immersed herself in principles set forth by all manner of experts, from Epicurus to Thoreau to Oprah to Martin Seligman to the Dalai Lama to see what worked for her\u2014and what didn't. Her conclusions are sometimes surprising\u2014she finds that money can buy happiness, when spent wisely; that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that \"treating\" yourself can make you feel worse; that venting bad feelings doesn't relieve them; that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference\u2014and they range from the practical to the profound. Written with charm and wit, The Happiness Project is illuminating yet entertaining, thought-provoking yet compulsively readable. Gretchen Rubin's passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire you to start your own happiness project.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061583254"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061583251"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 3779, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YGxdG6UCD50C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YGxdG6UCD50C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YGxdG6UCD50C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0061583251&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YGxdG6UCD50C&dq=isbn:0061583251&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Happiness_Project.html?hl=&id=YGxdG6UCD50C", "isbn": "0061583251"}

{"title": "The Professor and the Madman", "subtitle": "A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of The Oxford English Dictionary", "authors": ["Simon Winchester"], "publisher": "Harper Collins", "publishedDate": "1998-08-26", "description": "Mysterious (mist\u00eee \u00b7 ries), a. [f. L. myst\u00e9rium Mysteryi + ous. Cf. F. myst\u00e9rieux.] 1. Full of or fraught with mystery; wrapt in mystery; hidden from human knowledge or understanding; impossible or difficult to explain, solve, or discover; of obscure origin, nature, or purpose. It is known as one of the greatest literary achievements in the history of English letters. The creation of the Oxford English Dictionary began in 1857, took seventy years to complete, drew from tens of thousands of brilliant minds, and organized the sprawling language into 414,825 precise definitions. But hidden within the rituals of its creation is a fascinating and mysterious story--a story of two remarkable men whose strange twenty-year relationship lies at the core of this historic undertaking. Professor James Murray, an astonishingly learned former schoolmaster and bank clerk, was the distinguished editor of the OED project. Dr. William Chester Minor, an American surgeon from New Haven, Connecticut, who had served in the Civil War, was one of thousands of contributors who submitted illustrative quotations of words to be used in the dictionary. But Minor was no ordinary contributor. He was remarkably prolific, sending thousands of neat, handwritten quotations from his home in the small village of Crowthorne, fifty miles from Oxford. On numerous occasions Murray invited Minor to visit Oxford and celebrate his work, but Murray's offer was regularly--and mysteriously--refused. Thus the two men, for two decades, maintained a close relationship only through correspondence. Finally, in 1896, after Minor had sent nearly ten thousand definitions to the dictionary but had still never traveled from his home, a puzzled Murray set out to visit him. It was then that Murray finally learned the truth about Minor--that, in addition to being a masterful wordsmith, Minor was also a murderer, clinically insane--and locked up in Broadmoor, England's harshest asylum for criminal lunatics. The Professor and the Madman is an extraordinary tale of madness and genius, and the incredible obsessions of two men at the heart of the Oxford English Dictionary and literary history. With riveting insight and detail, Simon Winchester crafts a fascinating glimpse into one man's tortured mind and his contribution to another man's magnificent dictionary.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060175962"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060175966"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 3616, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WV5XVjdF0xYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WV5XVjdF0xYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=WV5XVjdF0xYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0060175966&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=WV5XVjdF0xYC&dq=isbn:0060175966&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Professor_and_the_Madman.html?hl=&id=WV5XVjdF0xYC", "isbn": "0060175966"}

{"title": "The Map That Changed the World", "subtitle": "William Smith and the Birth of Modern Geology", "authors": ["Simon Winchester"], "publisher": "Harper", "publishedDate": "2001-08-07", "description": "From the author of the bestselling The Professor and the Madman comes the fascinating story of William Smith, the orphaned son of an English country blacksmith, who became obsessed with creating the world's first geological map and ultimately became the father of modern geology. In 1793 William Smith, a canal digger, made a startling discovery that was to turn the fledgling science of the history of the earth -- and a central plank of established Christian religion -- on its head. He noticed that the rocks he was excavating were arranged in layers; more important, he could see quite clearly that the fossils found in one layer were very different from those found in another. And out of that realization came an epiphany: that by following the fossils, one could trace layers of rocks as they dipped and rose and fell -- clear across England and, indeed, clear across the world. Determined to publish his profoundly important discovery by creating a map that would display the hidden underside of England, he spent twenty years traveling the length and breadth of the kingdom by stagecoach and on foot, studying rock outcrops and fossils, piecing together the image of this unseen universe. In 1815 he published his epochal and remarkably beautiful hand-painted map, more than eight feet tall and six feet wide. But four years after its triumphant publication, and with his young wife going steadily mad to the point of nymphomania, Smith ended up in debtors' prison, a victim of plagiarism, swindled out of his recognition and his profits. He left London for the north of England and remained homeless for ten long years as he searched for work. It wasn't until 1831, when his employer, a sympathetic nobleman, brought him into contact with the Geological Society of London -- which had earlier denied him a fellowship -- that at last this quiet genius was showered with the honors long overdue him. He was summoned south to receive the society's highest award, and King William IV offered him a lifetime pension. The Map That Changed the World is, at its foundation, a very human tale of endurance and achievement, of one man's dedication in the face of ruin and homelessness. The world's coal and oil industry, its gold mining, its highway systems, and its railroad routes were all derived entirely from the creation of Smith's first map.; and with a keen eye and thoughtful detail, Simon Winchester unfolds the poignant sacrifice behind this world-changing discovery.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060193611"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060193614"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=hyodxgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060193611&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=hyodxgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060193611&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Map_That_Changed_the_World.html?hl=&id=hyodxgEACAAJ", "isbn": "0060193611"}

Minutes later, a huge bomb detonates a hundred feet above the ground and lays waste to homes, cars, and playgrounds: a town annihilated in an instant. Alex Cross is on vacation in San Francisco with his girlfriend, Jamilla Hughes, when he gets the call. The Russian supercriminal known as the Wolf claims responsibility for the blast. The Wolf is the deadliest nemesis Cross has ever faced, and the fact that he is still at large is agonizing for him and his new bosses at the FBI. Major cities around the globe, including London, Paris, and New York, are threatened with total destruction. The Wolf has proven he can do it - the only question is who can stop him in time. Surveillance film of the blast reveals the presence of another of Alex Cross's most dangerous enemies, the ruthless assassin known as the Weasel. The thought of these two dark geniuses joining forces makes Alex's blood run cold. Now are you scared? World leaders have just four days to prevent an unimaginable cataclysm. In a matter of hours, Cross is catapulted into an international chase of astonishing danger. Joining forces with Scotland Yard and Interpol, Alex fights his way through a torrent of false leads, impersonators, and foreign agents before he gets close to the heart of the crimes.

{"title": "Death Row", "subtitle": "A Novel", "authors": ["William Bernhardt"], "publisher": "Ballantine Books", "publishedDate": "2003-06-03", "description": "William Bernhardt\u2019s powerful series of legal thrillers featuring crusading attorney Ben Kincaid have won him a die-hard following and widespread critical acclaim as a \u201cmaster of the courtroom drama\u201d (Library Journal). Now, on the heels of his national bestseller Criminal Intent, William Bernhardt returns with his most electrifying novel to date. Oklahoma attorney Ben Kincaid put his reputation on the line when he represented Ray Goldman. The seemingly mild-mannered industrial chemist was charged with a staggeringly brutal crime: the torture and massacre of an entire suburban Tulsa family. But in spite of the grisly, tabloid-ready details of the sensational case, Ben\u2019s deft defense against a lack of hard evidence and improper police procedure made an acquittal all but certain. Until the prosecution\u2019s star witness\u2014the lone survivor of the slaughter\u2014took the stand . . . and sealed Ray Goldman\u2019s fate. Seven years later, Goldman\u2019s date with the death chamber is at hand. But seconds before the lethal injection, an eleventh-hour reprieve halts the execution\u2014and launches Ben on a race against time to overturn Ray Goldman\u2019s conviction. Erin Faulkner, the young woman who narrowly escaped the carnage that claimed her family, has abruptly recanted her testimony, after years of silence desperate to keep an innocent man from dying. Just as suddenly, this near-miraculous turn of events turns tragic: Erin is discovered dead, an apparent suicide. And Ben Kincaid is the only witness to her stunning confession. Ben is certain Erin didn\u2019t commit suicide. She was a victim of murder\u2014 silenced by the same killer who butchered her family. All Ben has to do is prove it. But his unseen enemy is determined to cover his tracks once and for all . . . with blood. In Death Row, William Bernhardt ratchets up the suspense quotient to near-heartstopping new levels\u2014and challenges even the most jaded thriller readers to keep up with the twists and turns. Crime will never pay.

The Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. But now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end. Homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. And in the cheap hotel where Landsman has washed up, someone has just committed a murder\u2014right under his nose. When he begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy, word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, and Landsman finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, evil, and salvation that are his heritage.

Only eleven of Emily Dickinson's poems were published prior to her death in 1886; the startling originality of her work doomed it to obscurity in her lifetime. Early posthumous published collections -- some of them featuring liberally \"edited\" versions of the poems -- did not fully and accurately represent Dickinson's bold experiments in prosody, her tragic vision, and the range of her intellectual and emotional explorations. Not until the 1955 publication of The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, a three-volume critical edition compiled by Thomas H. Johnson, were readers able for the first time to assess, understand, and appreciate the whole of Dickinson's extraordinary poetic genius. This book, a distillation of the three-volume Complete Poems, brings together the original texts of all 1,775 poems that Emily Dickinson wrote. \"With its chronological arrangement of the poems, this volume becomes more than just a collection; it is at the same time a poetic biography of the thoughts and feelings of a woman whose beauty was deep and lasting.\" --San Francisco Chronicle", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316184144"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316184144"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 770, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Poetry"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 594, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.11.3.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CUUf2bWJ8joC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CUUf2bWJ8joC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=CUUf2bWJ8joC&pg=PP1&dq=isbn:0316184144&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=CUUf2bWJ8joC&dq=isbn:0316184144&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Dickinson.html?hl=&id=CUUf2bWJ8joC", "isbn": "0316184144"}

Black maids raise white children, but aren't trusted not to steal the silver. Some lines will never be crossed. Aibileen is a black maid: smart, regal, and raising her seventeenth white child. Yet something shifted inside Aibileen the day her own son died while his bosses looked the other way. Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is by some way the sassiest woman in Mississippi. But even her extraordinary cooking won't protect Minny from the consequences of her tongue. Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter returns home with a degree and a head full of hope, but her mother will not be happy until there's a ring on her finger. Seeking solace with Constantine, the beloved maid who raised her, Skeeter finds she has gone. But why will no one tell her where? Seemingly as different as can be, Skeeter, Aibileen and Minny's lives converge over a clandestine project that will not only put them all at risk but also change the town of Jackson for ever. But why? And for what? The Help is a deeply moving, timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we won't. Itis about how women, whether mothers or daughters, the help or the boss, relate to each other - and that terrible feeling that those who look after your children may understand them, even love them, better than you . . .", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780141039282"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0141039280"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4211, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.6.3.0.preview.2", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rlx0h-_1bCUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rlx0h-_1bCUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rlx0h-_1bCUC&dq=isbn:0141039280&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rlx0h-_1bCUC&dq=isbn:0141039280&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Help.html?hl=&id=rlx0h-_1bCUC", "isbn": "0141039280"}

{"title": "A Little House Reader", "authors": ["Laura Ingalls Wilder"], "publisher": "HarperColl", "publishedDate": "1998-01-16", "description": "Laura Ingalls Wilder, whose Little House books have delighted generations of readers, was a writer long before she ever recorded the adventures of her pioneer girlhood. She first began experimenting with words as a young girl in Dakota Territory, writing poetry about her beloved prairies, her sister Mary, and her courtship with Almanzo Wilder. Eventually, Laura and Almanzo married and settled in the Ozark Mountains, where Laura became a widely known and well-respected journalist, penning her thoughts on farming and the life of a farmwife. She also wrote private sketches about her family, politics, nature, and eternity. Noted author and Little House historian William Anderson has delved deeply into the Ingalls and Wilder papers and has put together a unique medley of Laura's writings from the time before her Little House books. Culled mostly from fragile and yellowed pieces of paper, this moving collection offers a window into Laura's day-to-day life and experiences, giving us a richer understanding of the woman and writer famed for her Little House books. Even before she wrote the Little House books, Laura Ingalls Wilder was an avid writer. She wrote both newspaper and magazine articles and spent many evenings on Rocky Ridge Farm jotting down her thoughts and memories. Noted Little House historian William Anderson has compiled these writings, some never before published, into a moving collection touching on everything from family and farm life to time and eternity. Both a testimonial and a tribute, this collection offers us a richer understanding of the woman and writer famed for her Little House books.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "006026358X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060263584"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 196, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Juvenile Nonfiction"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.14.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-awOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-awOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-awOAQAAMAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=isbn:006026358X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-awOAQAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:006026358X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Little_House_Reader.html?hl=&id=-awOAQAAMAAJ", "isbn": "006026358X"}

Such a book, we submit, is Old Yeller; to read this eloIquently simple story of a boy and his dog in the Texas hill country is an unforgettable and deeply moving experience. The big, ugly, yellow dog showed up out of nowhere one night and stole a whole side of hanging pork, and when Travis went for him the next morning that dog started yelling like a baby before he was touched. Then he got into the spring water with five-year-old Arliss, Travis took an easy hate to Old Yeller, as they started to call him; in fact, he would have driven him off or killed him if it hadn't been for brother Arliss' loud and violent protests, So Yeller stayed, and Travis soon found he couldn't have got along without him. Pa and Ma and Travis and Arliss lived on Birdsong Creek in the Texas hill country. It wasn't an easy life, but they had a snug cabin that Pa had built himself, and they had their own hogs and their own cattle, and they grew most of what else they needed. The only thing they and the rest of the settlers lacked that year in the late 1860's was cash, so the men decided to get together and drive all the cattle up to the new market in Abilene, Kansas, more than six hundred miles away. Travis was only fourteen, but he was proud of his new role as man of the family and determined to live up to his responsibility. It was hard work, too, plowing until his legs ached, chopping wood until his hands were raw and his head was spinning, weeding the garden in the hot sun, toting the heavy buckets tip from the spring, and trying to keep his mischievous little brother in line. But there were pleasant moments, too: his Ma treating him like a man, and deer hunting in the early-morning stillness, and hot summer nights out in the corn patch under the stars with Old Yeller, trying to keep the coons and skunks out of the winter food supply. And there was plenty of excitement, like the fight between the two bulls, and the time Arliss nearly got mauled by the bear, and trying to catch and mark the new hogs. Here the suspense and excitement reach a peak, only to be topped a few pages later when the crazy-sick loafer wolf goes for Ma. Both times it is Yeller who saves them, only the second time it is not lucky for Yeller, as Travis comes to find out. And in finding out, Travis learns just how much he has come to love that big ugly dog, and he learns something about the pain of life, too. Old Yeller is a story that will be read and treasured by many thousands for years to come.

And he fully expects his best friend Poppy, a deer mouse, to help him celebrate in a grand manner. But Poppy has gone off somewhere with her husband, Rye, and it appears she has forgotten all about it. \"Belching Beavers,\" says Ereth, \"I am not angry!\" (Though, perhaps he is\u2014and more than just a little.) Ereth knows his special occasion deserves a special treat\u2014even if he has to get it for himself. And what treat could be more special than tasty salt? But the nearest salt is located deep in the forest, in a cabin occupied by fur hunters, who have set out traps to capture the Dimwood Forest animals. In one of the traps, Ereth finds Leaper the Fox\u2014who, with her dying breath, begs the prickly porcupine to take care of her three boisterous young kits, Tumble, Nimble, and Flip. \"Jellied walrus warts!\" Ereth exclaims, but reluctantly agrees. Certainly this day is not going as he planned\u2014and it's only just the beginning! Not only does Ereth suddenly have a rambunctious new family to take care of, but he's being stalked by Marty the Fisher, the one creature in Dimwood Forest who can do him harm. And Bounder, the father of the three little foxes, remembers all too well the nose full of quills he got a while back from the grumpy old animal who now fancies himself the leader of the den. He too sets out to show Ereth who's boss.

Somewhere on the frontier between thought and reality exists the Discworld, a parallel time and place which might sound and smell very much like our own, but which looks completely different. It plays by different rules. Certainly it refuses to succumb to the quaint notion that universes are ruled by pure logic and the harmony of numbers. But just because the Disc is different doesn't mean that some things don't stay the same. Its very existence is about to be threatened by a strange new blight: the arrival of the first tourist, upon whose survival rests the peace and prosperity of the land. But if the person charged with maintaining that survival in the face of robbers, mercenaries and, well, Death is a spectacularly inept wizard, a little logic might turn out to be a very good idea...

To avoid drawing the attention of the enemy through the busy signals of an industrial civilization, the human rulers of Safehold have taken an extraordinary measure. With mind control and hidden high technology, they have built a religion in which every Safeholdian believes, one designed to keep Safehold society medieval and unnoticed forever. After disagreement about the wisdom and justice of this course, the dissenters were ruthlessly eliminated. Centuries have passed and now, in a hidden chamber on Safehold, an android initiates a rebirth set in motion centuries before. A rebirth that will provide the only remaining humans with their last chance to learn the truth and to rejoin the universe.

Like calling Fat Charlie \"Fat Charlie.\" Even now, twenty years later, Charlie Nancy can't shake that name, one of the many embarrassing \"gifts\" his father bestowed -- before he dropped dead on a karaoke stage and ruined Fat Charlie's life. Mr. Nancy left Fat Charlie things. Things like the tall, good-looking stranger who appears on Charlie's doorstep, who appears to be the brother he never knew. A brother as different from Charlie as night is from day, a brother who's going to show Charlie how to lighten up and have a little fun ... just like Dear Old Dad. And all of a sudden, life starts getting very interesting for Fat Charlie. Because, you see, Charlie's dad wasn't just any dad. He was Anansi, a trickster god, the spider-god. Anansi is the spirit of rebellion, able to overturn the social order, create wealth out of thin air, and baffle the devil. Some said he could cheat even Death himself. Returning to the territory he so brilliantly explored in his masterful New York Times bestseller, American Gods, the incomparable Neil Gaiman offers up a work of dazzling ingenuity, a kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth that is at once startling, terrifying, exhilarating, and fiercely funny -- a true wonder of a novel that confirms Stephen King's glowing assessment of the author as \"a treasure-house of story, and we are lucky to have him.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060515188"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "006051518X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 252, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V-VxwZFj5h8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V-VxwZFj5h8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=V-VxwZFj5h8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:006051518X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=V-VxwZFj5h8C&dq=isbn:006051518X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Anansi_Boys.html?hl=&id=V-VxwZFj5h8C", "isbn": "006051518X"}

He became severely ill on the journey, nearly dying in the jungle from a blood infection and malaria. A mere five years later Roosevelt did die of related issues. One extraordinary factor is the resistance and disbelief the well-respected Roosevelt faced upon what should have been a triumphant return. The region was considered so dangerous that most reputable exploration societies considered Roosevelt's discoveries improbable.

{"title": "The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni", "subtitle": "1968-1998", "authors": ["Nikki Giovanni"], "publisher": "William Morrow", "publishedDate": "2003-11-25", "description": "For the first time ever, the complete poetry collection spanning three decades from Nikki Giovanni, renowned poet and one of America's national treasures. When her poems first emerged during the Black Arts Movement in the 1960s, Nikki Giovanni immediately took her place among the most celebrated, controversial, and influential poets of the era. Now, more than thirty years later, Giovanni still stands as one of the most commanding, luminous voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape. The first of its kind, this omnibus collection covers Nikki Giovanni's complete work of poetry from three decades, 1968\u20131998. The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni contains Giovanni's first seven volumes of poetry: Black Feeling Black Talk, Black Judgement, Re: Creation, My House, The Women and the Men, Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day, and Those Who Ride the Night Winds. Arranged chronologically with a biographical timeline and introduction, a new afterword from the author, title and first-line indexes, and extensive notes to the poems, this collection is the testimony of a life's work -- from one of America's most beloved daughters and powerful poets. Known for their iconic revolutionary phrases, Black Feeling Black Talk (1968), Black Judgement (1968), and Re: Creation (1970) are heralded as being among the most important volumes of contemporary poetry. My House (1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosophy -- it signifies a new self-confidence and maturity as Giovanni artfully connects the private and the public, the personal and the political. In The Women and the Men (1975), Giovanni displays her compassion for the people, things, and places she has encountered -- she reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary. Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day (1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s -- in both the consciousness of the nation and in the soul of the poet -- when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated. Those Who Ride the Night Winds (1983) is devoted to \"the day trippers and midnight cowboys,\" the ones who have devoted their lives to pushing the limits of the human condition and shattering the constraints of the status quo. Each volume reflects the changes Giovanni has endured as a Black woman, lover, mother, teacher, and poet. A timeless classic, The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni is the evocation of a nation's past and present -- intensely personal and fiercely political -- from one of our most compassionate, vibrant observers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060541334"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060541330"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 496, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Poetry"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5DmJvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5DmJvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5DmJvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060541334&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5DmJvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060541334&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Collected_Poetry_of_Nikki_Giovanni.html?hl=&id=5DmJvgEACAAJ", "isbn": "0060541334"}

In this honest, frank analysis, Paul and Brendan Moynihan revisit the events that led to Paul's disastrous decision and examine the psychological factors behind bad financial practices in several economic sectors. This book--winner of a 2014 Axiom Business Book award gold medal--begins with the unbroken string of successes that helped Paul achieve a jet-setting lifestyle and land a key spot with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It then describes the circumstances leading up to Paul's $1.6 million loss and the essential lessons he learned from it--primarily that, although there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people participating in them, all losses come from the same few sources. Investors lose money in the markets either because of errors in their analysis or because of psychological barriers preventing the application of analysis. While all analytical methods have some validity and make allowances for instances in which they do not work, psychological factors can keep an investor in a losing position, causing him to abandon one method for another in order to rationalize the decisions already made. Paul and Moynihan's cautionary tale includes strategies for avoiding loss tied to a simple framework for understanding, accepting, and dodging the dangers of investing, trading, and speculating.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780231164689"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0231164688"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NV2rAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NV2rAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=NV2rAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0231164688&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=NV2rAgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0231164688&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/What_I_Learned_Losing_a_Million_Dollars.html?hl=&id=NV2rAgAAQBAJ", "isbn": "0231164688"}

As they had done throughout Europe, the Nazis could now plunder the masterpieces of the Renaissance, the treasures of the Vatican, and the antiquities of the Roman Empire. On the eve of the Allied invasion, General Dwight Eisenhower empowered a new kind of soldier to protect these historic riches. In May 1944 two unlikely American heroes\u2014artist Deane Keller and scholar Fred Hartt\u2014embarked from Naples on the treasure hunt of a lifetime, tracking billions of dollars of missing art, including works by Michelangelo, Donatello, Titian, Caravaggio, and Botticelli. With the German army retreating up the Italian peninsula, orders came from the highest levels of the Nazi government to transport truckloads of art north across the border into the Reich. Standing in the way was General Karl Wolff, a top-level Nazi officer. As German forces blew up the magnificent bridges of Florence, General Wolff commandeered the great collections of the Uffizi Gallery and Pitti Palace, later risking his life to negotiate a secret Nazi surrender with American spymaster Allen Dulles.

In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female photographer during the L.A. riots. Harry originally investigated the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force and never solved. Now Bosch's ballistics match indicates that her death was not random violence, but something more personal, and connected to a deeper intrigue. Like an investigator combing through the wreckage after a plane crash, Bosch searches for the \"black box,\" the one piece of evidence that will pull the case together. Riveting and relentlessly paced, The Black Box leads Harry Bosch, \"one of the greats of crime fiction\" (New York Daily News), into one of his most fraught and perilous cases.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316069434"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316069434"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=CGkuugEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316069434&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=CGkuugEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316069434&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Box.html?hl=&id=CGkuugEACAAJ", "isbn": "0316069434"}
