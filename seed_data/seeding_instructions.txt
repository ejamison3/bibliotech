HOW TO ADD USERNAMES TO REVIEWS FILE
1. Run create_usernames('seed_data/reviews.json', 'seed_data/reviews_names.json', 'seed_data/long_names') 
    This creates reviews_names.json which adds username values to json
2. Look through long_names file and substitute usernames so that they are under 20 chars (max limit per DB design)
    There were 4 substitutions required. Since the file is a one time create, I did this substitution manually.

HOW TO GET BOOK ID LIST FROM reviews.json TYPE FILE
1. Run make_book_id_file(reviews.json, book_id_list)
    - function in reviews.py

HOW TO CREATE BOOK SEED FILE
1. Using the file created above (book_id_list), run create_google_seed_file(book_id_file, book_seed_file.json, error_file) from the seed_db.py file
    Put in the names you want the book_seed_file and error_file to have

HOW TO SEED DATABASE
1. Load book_seed_file created above using create_book_author('seed_data/book_seed_file_part#.json') 
  - function in seed_db.py file
2. Load reviews_names.json using create_user_rating('seed_data/reviews_names.json', 'rating_errors')
  - function in seed_db.py file
3. Create and populate average ratings: create_average_ratings()

HOW TO HANDLE ERRORS 
There are two error files: 
    - book_error_file which has isbn of books with no or many books returned from google books
    - rating_errors which has [reviewerID] [asin] for books that DNE in database
1. Books in book_error_file with multiple books have been run again (book_id_list_part3) and the first response chosen. 
2. Books without google can be looked up manually or just forgotten
  a. If several are looked up manually, revisit NYT book seeding functions & create manual seed files
3. After as many books have been added as desired in step 1 & 2, reload reviews.json file and create a new rating_errors. If there are still a large number of reviews being skipped, go back and add more missing books.
ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS
4. Create a loaded_reviews.json file by parsing out unloaded books
  - Create function to make pipe separated list of unloaded books
  - egrep -v [pipe separated list] reviews.json > loaded_reviews.json
