HOW TO GET BOOK ID LIST FROM reviews.json TYPE FILE
1. Run make_book_id_file(reviews.json, book_id_list)
    - function in reviews.py

HOW TO CREATE BOOK SEED FILE
1. Using the file created above (book_id_list), run create_google_seed_file(book_id_file, book_seed_file.json, error_file) from the seed_db.py file
    Put in the names you want the book_seed_file and error_file to have

HOW TO SEED DATABASE
1. Load book_seed_file created above using create_book_author('book_seed_file.json') 
  - function in seed_db.py file
2. Load reviews.json (or reviews_small.json) using create_user_rating('reviews.json', 'rating_errors')
  - function in seed_db.py file

HOW TO HANDLE ERRORS 
There are two error files: 
    - book_error_file which has isbn of books with no or many books returned from google books
    - rating_errors which has [reviewerID] [asin] for books that DNE in database
1. Books in book_error_file with multiple books should be looked up with postman and have appropriate book added to book_seed_file
2. Books without google can be looked up manually or just forgotten
  a. If several are looked up manually, revisit NYT book seeding functions & create manual seed files
3. After as many books have been added as desired in step 1 & 2, reload reviews.json file and create a new rating_errors. If there are still a large number of reviews being skipped, go back and add more missing books.
ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS
4. Create a loaded_reviews.json file by parsing out unloaded books
  - Create function to make pipe separated list of unloaded books
  - egrep -v [pipe separated list] reviews.json > loaded_reviews.json
