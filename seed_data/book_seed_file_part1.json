It was lost in Washington, D.C.\" -- H. R. McMaster (from the Conclusion) Dereliction Of Duty is a stunning new analysis of how and why the United States became involved in an all-out and disastrous war in Southeast Asia. Fully and convincingly researched, based on recently released transcripts and personal accounts of crucial meetings, confrontations and decisions, it is the only book that fully re-creates what happened and why. It also pinpoints the policies and decisions that got the United States into the morass and reveals who made these decisions and the motives behind them, disproving the published theories of other historians and excuses of the participants. Dereliction Of Duty covers the story in strong narrative fashion, focusing on a fascinating cast of characters: President Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, General Maxwell Taylor, McGeorge Bundy and other top aides who deliberately deceived the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the U.S. Congress and the American public. Sure to generate controversy, Dereliction Of Duty is an explosive and authoritative new look at the controversy concerning the United States involvement in Vietnam.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060187956"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060187958"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I7d6MAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I7d6MAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=I7d6MAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060187956&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=I7d6MAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060187956&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dereliction_of_Duty.html?hl=&id=I7d6MAEACAAJ", "isbn": "0060187956"}

The breakup was devastating. It was like a divorce when all the friends you had as a couple are forced to choose sides and end up not choosing yours. Sarah Sentilles's relationship with God was not casual. When it began to unravel she was in the ordination process to become an Episcopal priest, a youth minister at a church, and a doctoral student in theology at Harvard. You might say they were engaged and that the wedding was all planned. Calling it off would be more than a little awkward. But in the studying of the religion she'd been raised on and believed wholeheartedly, one day she woke up and realized . . . it was over. In this powerful memoir of faith, Sentilles reveals how deep our ties to God can be, and how devastating they can be to break. Without God to mold herself to and without religion as her script, who was she and what was her purpose? Her relationship with God had been connected to everything\u2014her family, her friends, her vocation, the places she frequented, the language she used, and her way of being in the world. Not unlike after a divorce, she had to reorient her life and face a future that felt darkly unfamiliar.

{"title": "The New Testament", "subtitle": "A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings", "authors": ["Bart D. Ehrman"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "publishedDate": "2000", "description": "This lucid introduction approaches the New Testament from a consistently historical and comparative perspective, emphasizing the rich diversity of the earliest Christian literature. Rather than styling away from the critical problems presented by these books, Ehrman addresses the historicaland literary challenges they pose and shows why scholars continue to argue over such significant issues as how the books of the New Testament came into being, who produced them, what they mean, how they relate to contemporary Christian and non-Christian liteature, and how how they came to becollected into a canon of Scripture. Distinctive to this study is its emphasis on the historical, literary, and religious milieu of the Greco-Roman world, including early Judiasm. As part of its historical orientation, this text also discusses works by other Christian writers who were roughlycontemporary with the New Testament, such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Apocalypse of Peter, the letters of Ignatius. Instead of simply setting forth scholarly views without explanations, Ehrman includes the evidence of scholars that have found persuasive for their views, engaging students anddemonstrating why scholars have taken the positions they have. Ideal for undergraduate and seminary classes in the New Testament, Biblical Studies, and Christian Origins, The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, Second Edition, is an accessible, clearly writtenintroduction that encourages students to consider the historical issues surrounding these writings. The book is equally appealling to the wide non-academic readership interested in the Bible and the historical Jesus. Ehrman's The New Testament and Other Writings: A Reader serves as an idealcompanion to this text.Features new to the second edition include expanded material covering Jesus, and the addition of boxes throughout addressing numerous topics, including alternative approaches to the historical Jesus and additional material covering women.

The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era\u2019s great transatlantic \u201cGreyhounds\u201d\u2014the fastest liner then in service\u2014and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger\u2019s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small\u2014hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more\u2014all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don\u2019t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307408860"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307408868"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 430, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 3884, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "2.2.1.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qhW3BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qhW3BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=qhW3BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0307408868&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=qhW3BgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0307408868&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dead_Wake.html?hl=&id=qhW3BgAAQBAJ", "isbn": "0307408868"}

They were ferocious eaters and talkers, devouring rumors and innuendo with gusto. Food was their common language, and everyone understood the dialects.\" -- Aunt Tempe, reminiscing about family dinners From Michael Lee West, author of the acclaimed American Pie, She Flew the Coop, and Crazy Ladies, comes a delightfully quirky memoir of an adventurous food-obsessed life, laced with delicious secret recipes passed from generation to generation. Wonderfully presented and thoroughly entertaining, this warm and witty work unites West's evocative voice and humor with the uniquely American form of kitchen tales in the tradition of Laurie Colwin. West lends her distinctive humor and often hilarious insights to stories about her trials and tribulations as a Southern woman who became an \"accidental gourmet.\" In this irresistible memoir mothers swing from chandeliers, elderly aunts brew love potions, a South American nymphomaniac stirs up trouble at a Louisiana barbecue joint, Margaret Mitchell's bed is discovered during a routine antique hunt, a cabbage-eating ghost haunts relatives, mother and daughter peek under fig leaves on statues, and bees attack--all in pursuit of good food. By watching a multitude of relatives cook, squabble, and carry on tradition, Michael Lee West went from a noncooking student to a full-on gourmet of food and words. Using her own experience and the witticisms of relatives, or clever inspirations overheard in parking lots on the way to the mayor's funeral, West fills these pages with insights such as: \"Potato salad is our friend. It will never let you down. It's a shame we have to eat it, but that's life\" and \"Live and learn. Die and get food.

Box delivers a thriller about a troubled cop trying to save his son from a killer in Yellowstone. Cody Hoyt, while a brilliant cop, is an alcoholic struggling with two months of sobriety when his mentor and AA sponsor Hank Winters is found burned to death in a remote mountain cabin. At first it looks like the suicide of a man who's fallen off the wagon, but Cody knows Hank better than that. Sober for fourteen years, Hank took pride in his hard-won sobriety and never hesitated to drop whatever he was doing to talk Cody off a ledge. When Cody takes a closer look at the scene of his friend's death, it becomes apparent that foul play is at hand. After years of bad behavior with his department, he's in no position to be investigating a homicide, but this man was a friend and Cody's determined to find his killer. When clues found at the scene link the murderer to an outfitter leading tourists on a multi-day wilderness horseback trip into the remote corners of Yellowstone National Park--a pack trip that includes his son Justin--Cody is desperate to get on their trail and stop the killer before the group heads into the wild. Among the tourists is fourteen-year-old Gracie Sullivan, an awkward but intelligent loner who begins to suspect that someone in their party is dangerous. In a fatal cat and mouse game, where it becomes apparent the murderer is somehow aware of Cody's every move, Cody treks into the wilderness to stop a killer hell bent on ruining the only thing in his life he cares about.

If Offred refuses to enter into sexual servitude to repopulate a devastated world, she will be hanged. Yet even a repressive state cannot eradicate hope and desire. As she recalls her pre-revolution life in flashbacks, Offred must navigate through the terrifying landscape of torture and persecution in the present day, and between two men upon which her future hangs. Masterfully conceived and executed, this haunting vision of the future places Margaret Atwood at the forefront of dystopian fiction.

Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger? Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final \"class\": lessons in how to live. Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780307275639"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0307275639"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 192, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Education"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 217, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T5PqPWS0GKwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T5PqPWS0GKwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=T5PqPWS0GKwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0307275639&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=T5PqPWS0GKwC&dq=isbn:0307275639&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Tuesdays_with_Morrie.html?hl=&id=T5PqPWS0GKwC", "isbn": "0307275639"}

Brought together under the most unlikely circumstance, Murph and Sarah begin in friendship and wind up in impossible possible love.

Through his often-extravagant behavior and observations, both hilarious and profound, we see the world in all its strange glory, equally beautiful and ridiculous. With memory at the center of his thoughts, he contemplates its power and accuracy and meaning. Our life begins in dreams, but does not stay with them, Murph reminds us. What use shall we make of the past? Ultimately, he asks, are relationships our noblest reason for living?

Feynman"], "publisher": "Basic Books", "publishedDate": "1996-04-10", "description": "Richard P. Feynman (1918\u20131988) was widely recognized as the most creative physicist of the post\u2013World War II period. His career was extraordinarily expansive. From his contributions to the development of the atomic bomb a Los Alamos during World War II to his work in quantum electrodynamics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965, Feynman was celebrated for his brilliant and irreverent approach to physics.It was Feynman's outrageous and scintillating method of teaching that earned him legendary status among students and professors of physics. From 1961\u20131963, Feynman, at the California Institute of Technology, delivered a series of lectures that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from the famous Lectures on Physics, represents the most accessible material from this series. In these six chapters, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, the relationship of physics to other topics, energy, gravitation, and quantum force. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion without equations or technical jargon.Readers will remember how\u2014using ice water and rubber\u2014Feynman demonstrated with stunning simplicity to a nationally televised audience the physics of the 1986 Challenger disaster. It is precisely this ability\u2014the clear and direct illustration of complex theories\u2014that made Richard Feynman one of the most distinguished educators in the world. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations, Six Easy Pieces is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible scientists of our time.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0201408252"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780201408256"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 176, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=cc-fxwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0201408252&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=cc-fxwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0201408252&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Six_Easy_Pieces.html?hl=&id=cc-fxwEACAAJ", "isbn": "0201408252"}

John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It\u2019s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames\u2019s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family\u2019s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather\u2019s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend\u2019s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames\u2019s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life\u2019s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0002005883"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780002005883"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 247, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 171, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KQZCPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KQZCPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=KQZCPgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0002005883&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=KQZCPgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0002005883&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Gilead.html?hl=&id=KQZCPgAACAAJ", "isbn": "0002005883"}

His father was the most decorated U.S. Marine in history, but now resides in a nursing home far from his battlefield glory. Puller's older brother, also a military vet, is serving a life sentence in Leavenworth Penitentiary.

What neither of them knows is what is waiting for them across the street from the murdered family's home. It is something that will turn an already complicated case on its head.

Filled with insights that are the hallmark of Anna Quindlen's bestsellers, Miller's Valley is an emotionally powerful story about a family you will never forget. For generations the Millers have lived in Miller's Valley. Mimi Miller tells about her life with intimacy and honesty. As Mimi eavesdrops on her parents and quietly observes the people around her, she discovers more and more about the toxicity of family secrets, the dangers of gossip, the flaws of marriage, the inequalities of friendship and the risks of passion, loyalty, and love. Home, as Mimi begins to realize, can be \"a place where it's just as easy to feel lost as it is to feel content.\" Miller's Valley is a masterly study of family, memory, loss, and, ultimately, discovery, of finding true identity and a new vision of home. As Mimi says, \"No one ever leaves the town where they grew up, even if they go.\" Miller's Valley reminds us that the place where you grew up can disappear, and the people in it too, but all will live on in your heart forever.

Now Gemma takes center stage when a lethal crime of passion turns a recreational trip to Scotland into pure bloody business. Though her reputation for delving into the heart of murder is matched only by that of her former partner and current lover, Duncan Kincaid, newly appointed Detective Inspector Gemma James has never thought to question her friend Hazel Cavendish about her past. So it is quite a shock when Gemma learns that their holiday retreat to a hotel in the Scottish Highlands is, in fact, a homecoming for native daughter Hazel -- and an event that has provoked strong reactions from the small community. Something is definitely amiss -- and that something is quite possibly Donald Brodie, the charming if intense Scotsman who is a guest as well. The truth comes out before long: Hazel and Brodie were once lovers, despite a vicious, long-standing feud between their families, rival local distillers of fine whisky. Their affair was fierce and passionate, and its fire might not have burned out completely. Certainly Brodie, now the domineering head of the family business, believes his \"Juliet\" still belongs to him alone -- and he's prepared to destroy Hazel's English marriage to make it so. A brutal murder puts Hazel's very life in peril when she's arrested for the crime. Hazel is the logical suspect, but Gemma knows nothing is simple in this place of secrets and long-seething hatreds.

But when spirited music professor Primrose Trent arrives, it prompts the creation of an all-female singing group. Resurrecting themselves as The Chilbury Ladies' Choir, the women use their song and unity to embolden the community as the war tears through their lives.Dependable Mrs Tilling sees the choir as a chance to finally put herself first, and a welcome distraction from thoughts of her son fighting on the front line.

{"title": "Nickel and Dimed", "subtitle": "On (Not) Getting By in America", "authors": ["Barbara Ehrenreich"], "publisher": "Picador", "publishedDate": "2011-08-02", "description": "Our sharpest and most original social critic goes \"undercover\" as an unskilled worker to reveal the dark side of American prosperity. Millions of Americans work full time, year round, for poverty-level wages. In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a job -- any job -- can be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was offered. Moving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, she worked as a waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing-home aide, and a Wal-Mart sales clerk. She lived in trailer parks and crumbling residential motels. Very quickly, she discovered that no job is truly \"unskilled,\" that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort. She also learned that one job is not enough; you need at least two if you int to live indoors. Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity -- a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival. Read it for the smoldering clarity of Ehrenreich's perspective and for a rare view of how \"prosperity\" looks from the bottom. You will never see anything -- from a motel bathroom to a restaurant meal -- in quite the same way again.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0312626681"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780312626686"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 269, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dp8oYgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dp8oYgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=dp8oYgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0312626681&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=dp8oYgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0312626681&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Nickel_and_Dimed.html?hl=&id=dp8oYgEACAAJ", "isbn": "0312626681"}

Murder cases have the highest stakes and the biggest paydays, and they always mean Haller has to be at the top of his game. When Mickey learns that the victim was his own former client, a prostitute he thought he had rescued and put on the straight and narrow path, he knows he is on the hook for this one. He soon finds out that she was back in LA and back in the life. Far from saving her, Mickey may have been the one who put her in danger. Haunted by the ghosts of his past, Mickey must work tirelessly and bring all his skill to bear on a case that could mean his ultimate redemption or proof of his ultimate guilt.

{"title": "With the Old Breed", "authors": ["E. B. Sledge"], "publisher": "Random House", "publishedDate": "2011", "description": "The inspiration behind the HBO series THE PACIFIC This was a brutish, primitive hatred, as characteristic of the horror of war in the Pacific as the palm trees and the islandsa Landing on the beach at Peleliu in 1944 as twenty-year-old new recruit to the US Marines, Eugene Sledge can only try desperately to survive. At Peleliu and Okinawa - two of the fiercest and filthiest Pacific battles of WWII - he witnesses the dehumanising brutality displayed by both sides and the animal hatred that each soldier has for his enemy. During temporary lapses in the fighting, conditions on the islands mean that the Marines often can't wash, stay dry, dig latrines, or even find time to eat. Suffering from constant fear, fatigue, and filth, the struggle of simply living in a combat zone is utterly debilitating. Yet despite horrendous conditions Sledge finds time to keep notes that he would later turn into a book. Described as one of the finest memoirs to emerge from any war, With the Old Breed tells with compassion and honesty of the cruelty, bravery and deaths of the men he fought alongside, and of his own journey from patriotic innocence to battle-scarred veteran. 'Eugene Sledge became more than a legend with his memoir, With The Old Breed. He became a chronicler, a historian, a storyteller who turns the extremes of the war in the Pacific - the terror, the camaraderie, the banal and the extraordinary - into terms we mortals can grasp' Tom Hanks", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780091937522"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0091937523"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 323, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Peleliu, Battle of, Palau, 1944"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 31, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.19.1.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2fJe86a3PZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2fJe86a3PZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=2fJe86a3PZAC&dq=isbn:0091937523&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=2fJe86a3PZAC&dq=isbn:0091937523&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/With_the_Old_Breed.html?hl=&id=2fJe86a3PZAC", "isbn": "0091937523"}

Roxanne Coss, opera's most revered soprano, has mesmerized the international guests with her singing. It is a perfect evening\u2014until a band of gun-wielding terrorists breaks in through the air-conditioning vents and takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a panicked, life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite different, as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds and people from different countries and continents become compatriots. Without the demands of the world to shape their days, life on the inside becomes more beautiful than anything they had known before. At once riveting and impassioned, the narrative becomes a moving exploration of how people communicate when music is the only common language. Friendship, compassion, and the chance for great love lead the characters to forget the real danger that has been set in motion and cannot be stopped. Ann Patchett has written a novel that is as lyrical and profound as it is unforgettable. Bel Canto engenders in the reader the very passion for art and the language of music that its characters discover. As a reader, you find yourself fervently wanting this captivity to continue forever, even though you know that real life waits on the other side of the garden wall. A virtuoso performance by one of our best and most important writers, Bel Canto is a novel to be cherished.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060188733"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060188731"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 230, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zl428tiTsA4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zl428tiTsA4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=zl428tiTsA4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0060188731&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=zl428tiTsA4C&dq=isbn:0060188731&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Bel_Canto.html?hl=&id=zl428tiTsA4C", "isbn": "0060188731"}

Miller, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz is a true landmark of twentieth-century literature -- a chilling and still-provocative look at a post-apocalyptic future. In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes. Seriously funny, stunning, and tragic, eternally fresh, imaginative, and altogether remarkable, A Canticle for Leibowitz retains its ability to enthrall and amaze.

As a child growing up in North Korea, Hyeonseo Lee was one of millions trapped by a secretive and brutal communist regime. Her home on the border with China gave her some exposure to the world beyond the confines of the Hermit Kingdom and, as the famine of the 1990s struck, she began to wonder, question and to realise that she had been brainwashed her entire life. Given the repression, poverty and starvation she witnessed surely her country could not be, as she had been told the best on the planet ? Aged seventeen, she decided to escape North Korea. She could not have imagined that it would be twelve years before she was reunited with her family. She could not return, since rumours of her escape were spreading, and she and her family could incur the punishments of the government authorities involving imprisonment, torture, and possible public execution. Hyeonseo instead remained in China and rapidly learned Chinese in an effort to adapt and survive. Twelve years and two lifetimes later, she would return to the North Korean border in a daring mission to spirit her mother and brother to South Korea, on one of the most arduous, costly and dangerous journeys imaginable. This is the unique story not only of Hyeonseo s escape from the darkness into the light, but also of her coming of age, education and the resolve she found to rebuild her life not once, but twice first in China, then in South Korea. Strong, brave and eloquent, this memoir is a triumph of her remarkable spirit.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0007554850"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780007554850"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sn19oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sn19oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=sn19oAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0007554850&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=sn19oAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0007554850&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Girl_in_the_Red_Shoes.html?hl=&id=sn19oAEACAAJ", "isbn": "0007554850"}

{"title": "Fateful Harvest", "subtitle": "The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret", "authors": ["Duff Wilson"], "publisher": "Harper", "publishedDate": "2001-09-04", "description": "Quincy, Washington, had been a sleepy northwestern farming town until its rest is disturbed by a shocking secret beneath its once-fertile fields: chemical manufacturers are disposing of leftover toxic waste by selling it to unsuspecting farmers as fertilizer. The tainted fertilizer -- containing arsenic and cadmium, lead and dioxins-is believed to be destroying crops, sickening animals, and endangering the nation's food supply. And owing to a gaping regulatory loophole, it is completely legal. Up against the secrecy and greed of powerful corporations, a local lifelong tomboy and mother of four will make an impassioned stand. Patty Martin begins a fateful journey that will lead to her election as mayor, but also invite the resentment of most of her neighbors for daring to confront the industry that has been Quincy's lifeblood. Martin is joined by a small number of brave farmers who bring ingenuity, outrage, and an investigative reporter to the fight against seemingly insurmountable odds to expose the truth. They learn that toxic waste is turned into fertilizer around the world, spread on food-growing land, absorbed by plants, and, ultimately, consumed by all of us. Duff Wilson, whose Seattle Times series on this story was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, here provides the definitive account of a new and alarming environmental scandal. Fateful Harvest is a gripping study of corruption and courage, of recklessness and reckoning. It is a story that speaks to the greatest fears -- and ultimate hope -- in us all.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060193697"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060193690"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 5, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9vx_QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9vx_QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=9vx_QgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060193697&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=9vx_QgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060193697&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Fateful_Harvest.html?hl=&id=9vx_QgAACAAJ", "isbn": "0060193697"}

Out flew the many folded lash in his hand; over the backs of the startled steeds it writhed and hissed...'Ben-Hur is readily associated with its four film versions, yet Lew Wallace's epic novel of 1880 was a huge bestseller, written by a former soldier who had fought in American Civil War. Intended as a moral and inspirational narrative, Ben-Hur's life parallels that of Jesus as he makes a journey ofdiscovery and enlightenment through the Mediterranean world from Jerusalem through Nazareth to the galleys that carry him to shipwreck in the Aegean, and, finally, Rome. A spiritual tale of the quest for love, the recovery of identity and patrimony, Ben-Hur's vivid description is based on a breadthof research into the Bible and the Holy Lands that never fails to delight in its detail and realism. Like many other `toga novels', Ben-Hur is also marked by traces of contemporary issues - the dissent, division and moral contradiction of emerging imperial cultures, the `New Woman' question, andeven trade unionism. Unlike the film versions, the novel is a rich source of American Victorian concerns and tensions, as well as being one of the most entertaining of its genre.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0192831992"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780192831996"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "pageCount": 530, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YMwjxK9vBVkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YMwjxK9vBVkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YMwjxK9vBVkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0192831992&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YMwjxK9vBVkC&dq=isbn:0192831992&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Ben_Hur.html?hl=&id=YMwjxK9vBVkC", "isbn": "0192831992"}

Though her childhood is one of brutality and fear, T\u00c9t\u00c9 finds solace in the traditional rhythms of African drums and the voodoo loa she discovers through her fellow slaves. When twenty-year-old Toulouse Valmorain arrives on the island in 1770, it\u2019s with powdered wigs in his trunks and dreams of financial success in his mind. But running his father\u2019s plantation, Saint Lazare, is neither glamorous nor easy. Although Valmorain purchases young T\u00c9t\u00c9 for his bride, it is he who will become dependent on the services of his teenaged slave. Against the merciless backdrop of sugarcane fields, the lives of T\u00c9t\u00c9 and Valmorain grow ever more intertwined. When the bloody revolution of Toussaint Louverture arrives at the gates of Saint Lazare, they flee the brutal conditions of the French colony, soon to become Haiti, for the raucous, free-wheeling enterprise of New Orleans. There T\u00c9t\u00c9 finally forges a new life, but her connection to Valmorain is deeper than anyone knows and not easily severed. With an impressive richness of detail, and a narrative wit and brio second to none, Allende crafts the riveting story of one woman\u2019s determination to find love amid loss, to offer humanity though her own has been so battered, and to forge a new identity in the cruelest of circumstances.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061988243"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061988240"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=D7souwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061988243&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=D7souwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061988243&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Island_Beneath_the_Sea.html?hl=&id=D7souwEACAAJ", "isbn": "0061988243"}

{"title": "Thomas Jefferson", "subtitle": "Author of America", "authors": ["Christopher Hitchens"], "publisher": "Harper Collins", "publishedDate": "2005-05-31", "description": "In this unique biography of Thomas Jefferson, leading journalist and social critic Christopher Hitchens offers a startlingly new and provocative interpretation of our Founding Father. Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060598969"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060598964"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 208, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zV8P_3E1OCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zV8P_3E1OCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=zV8P_3E1OCIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0060598964&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=zV8P_3E1OCIC&dq=isbn:0060598964&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Thomas_Jefferson.html?hl=&id=zV8P_3E1OCIC", "isbn": "0060598964"}

Gladwell Examines How The Careers Of Bill Gates And The Performance Of World-Class Football Players Are Alike; What Top Fighter Pilots And The Beatles Have In Common; Why So Many Top Lawyers Are Jewish; Why Asians Are Good At Maths; And Why It Is Correct To Say That The Mathematician Who Solved Fermat'S Theorem Is Not A Genius. Just As He Did In Blink, Gladwell Overturns Many Of Our Conventional Notions And Creates An Entirely New Model For Seeing The World. Brilliant And Entertaining, This Is A Landmark Work That Will Simultaneously Delight And Illuminate.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0141036249"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780141036243"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 309, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Success"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 4201, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pwCEvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pwCEvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=pwCEvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0141036249&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=pwCEvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0141036249&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Outliers.html?hl=&id=pwCEvgEACAAJ", "isbn": "0141036249"}

I felt comfortable letting him lead, and he seemed to know what I needed. He always chose the best route, if ever there was a question, and my only job was to follow.\u201d Middle-aged, overweight, and acrophobic newspaperman Tom Ryan and miniature schnauzer Atticus M. Finch are an unlikely pair of mountaineers, but after a close friend dies of cancer, the two pay tribute to her by attempting to climb all forty-eight of New Hampshire\u2019s four-thousand-foot peaks twice in one winter while raising money for charity. In a rare test of endurance, Tom and Atticus set out on an adventure of a lifetime that takes them across hundreds of miles and deep into an enchanting but dangerous winter wonderland. Little did they know that their most difficult test would lie ahead, after they returned home. . . . At the heart of this remarkable journey is an extraordinary relationship that blurs the line between man and dog, an indelible bond that began when Tom, following the advice of Atticus\u2019s breeder, carried the pup wherever he went for the first month of their life together. Following Atticus is ultimately a story of transformation: how a five-pound puppy pierced the heart of a tough-as-nails newspaperman, opening his eyes to the world\u2019s beauty and its possibilities. It was a change that led to a new life among the mountains; an unforgettable saga of adventure, friendship, and the unlikeliest of family; and an inspiring tale of finding love and discovering your true self.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061997105"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061997102"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Pets"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 15, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TLc439-hP1kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TLc439-hP1kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=TLc439-hP1kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0061997102&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=TLc439-hP1kC&dq=isbn:0061997102&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Following_Atticus.html?hl=&id=TLc439-hP1kC", "isbn": "0061997102"}

From a small fishing village in 1929, the tale moves to the glamorous and decadent heart of Kyoto in the 1930s, where a young peasant girl is sold as servant and apprentice to a renowned geisha house. She tells her story many years later from the Waldorf Astoria in New York; it exquisitely evokes another culture, a different time and the details of an extraordinary way of life.

For over thirty years, in over twenty international bestsellers, he has a set a standard that has never been equaled. Now, with the Prometheus Deception, he proves that he is at the very pinnacle of his craft. Nicholas Bryson spent years as a deep cover operative for the American secret intelligence group, the Directorate. After critical undercover mission went horribly wrong, Bryson was retired to a new identity. Years later, his closely held cover is cracked and Bryson learns that the Directorate was not what it claimed - that he was a pawn in a complex scheme against his own country's interests. Now, it has become increasingly clear that the shadowy Directorate is headed for some dangerous endgame - but no one knows precisely who they are and what they are planning. With Bryson their only possible asset, the director of the CIA recruits Bryson to find, reinfiltrate, and stop the Directorate. But after years on the sidelines, Bryson's field skills are rusty, his contacts unreliable, and his instincts suspect. With everything he thought he knew about his own life in question, Bryson is all alone in a wilderness of mirrors - unsure what is and isn't true and who, if anyone, he can trust - with the future of millions in the balance.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "031225346X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780312253462"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NpwPTFbpLQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NpwPTFbpLQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=NpwPTFbpLQwC&pg=PP1&dq=isbn:031225346X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=NpwPTFbpLQwC&dq=isbn:031225346X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Prometheus_Deception.html?hl=&id=NpwPTFbpLQwC", "isbn": "031225346X"}

From sports to religion, politics to education, science to capitalism, and everything in between, Pratchett has skewered sacred cows with both laughter and wisdom, and exposed our warts, foibles, and eccentricities in a unique, entertaining, and ultimately serious way. At long last, Lady Sybil has lured her husband, Sam Vimes, on a well-deserved holiday away from the crime and grime of Ankh-Morpork. But for the commander of the City Watch, a vacation in the country is anything but relaxing. The balls, the teas, the muck\u2014not to mention all that fresh air and birdsong\u2014are more than a bit taxing on a cynical city-born and -bred copper. Yet a policeman will find a crime anywhere if he decides to look hard enough, and it\u2019s not long before a body is discovered, and Sam\u2014out of his jurisdiction, out of his element, and out of bacon sandwiches (thanks to his well-meaning wife)\u2014must rely on his instincts, guile, and street smarts to see justice done. As he sets off on the chase, though, he must remember to watch where he steps. . . . This is the countryside, after all, and the streets most definitely are not paved with gold. Hailed as the \u201cpurely funniest English writer since Wodehouse\u201d (Washington Post Book World), with a \u201csatirist\u2019s instinct for the absurd and a cartoonist\u2019s eye for the telling detail\u201d (Daily Telegraph, London), Terry Pratchett offers a novel of crime, class, prejudice, and punishment that shows this master at his dazzling best.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062011847"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062011848"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 87, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1lJquwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1lJquwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1lJquwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062011847&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1lJquwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062011847&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Snuff.html?hl=&id=1lJquwEACAAJ", "isbn": "0062011847"}

Straight through to the end. Whatever else you were planning to do next, nothing could be more important.\" --Barbara Kingsolver Twenty years ago, with The End of Nature, Bill McKibben offered one of the earliest warnings about global warming. Those warnings went mostly unheeded; now, he insists, we need to acknowledge that we've waited too long, and that massive change is not only unavoidable but already under way. Our old familiar globe is suddenly melting, drying, acidifying, flooding, and burning in ways that no human has ever seen. We've created, in very short order, a new planet, still recognizable but fundamentally different. We may as well call it Eaarth. That new planet is filled with new binds and traps. A changing world costs large sums to defend--think of the money that went to repair New Orleans, or the trillions it will take to transform our energy systems. But the endless economic growth that could underwrite such largesse depends on the stable planet we've managed to damage and degrade. We can't rely on old habits any longer. Our hope depends, McKibben argues, on scaling back--on building the kind of societies and economies that can hunker down, concentrate on essentials, and create the type of community (in the neighborhood, but also on the Internet) that will allow us to weather trouble on an unprecedented scale. Change--fundamental change--is our best hope on a planet suddenly and violently out of balance.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0312541198"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780312541194"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Nature"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 20, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VnM7cAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VnM7cAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=VnM7cAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0312541198&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=VnM7cAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0312541198&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Eaarth.html?hl=&id=VnM7cAAACAAJ", "isbn": "0312541198"}

Against this richly detailed canvas of alternate history and military strategy, Thomas Harlan sets the intricate and moving stories of four people.

His teacher, Ahmet,undertakes to follow Dwyrin and aid him, but Ahmet is drawn into service with the queen of Palmeyra. Thyatis is a young female warrior, extensively trained by her patron in the arts of covert warfare. And Maxian Atreus is Galens youngest brother, a physician and sorcerer.

Sebastian Rudd is not your typical street lawyer. He works out of a customized bulletproof van, complete with Wi-Fi, a bar, a small fridge, fine leather chairs, a hidden gun compartment, and a heavily armed driver. He has no firm, no partners, no associates, and only one employee, his driver, who's also his bodyguard, law clerk, confidant, and golf caddy. He lives alone in a small but extremely safe penthouse apartment, and his primary piece of furniture is a vintage pool table. He drinks small-batch bourbon and carries a gun. Sebastian defends people other lawyers won't go near: a drug-addled, tattooed kid rumored to be in a satanic cult, who is accused of molesting and murdering two little girls; a vicious crime lord on death row; a homeowner arrested for shooting at a SWAT team that mistakenly invaded his house. Why these clients? Because he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial, even if he, Sebastian, has to cheat to secure one. He hates injustice, doesn't like insurance companies, banks, or big corporations; he distrusts all levels of government and laughs at the justice system's notions of ethical behavior. Sebastian Rudd is one of John Grisham's most colorful, outrageous, and vividly drawn characters yet.

Shattered by grief and dreaming of vengeance, Penn Cage sees his family and his world collapsing around him. The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover. Most terrifying of all, Dr. Cage seems bent on self-destruction. Despite Penn's experience as a prosecutor in major murder trials, his father has frozen him out of the trial preparations--preferring to risk dying in prison to revealing the truth of the crime to his son. During forty years practicing medicine, Tom Cage made himself the most respected and beloved physician in Natchez, Mississippi. But this revered Southern figure has secrets known only to himself and a handful of others. Among them, Tom has a second son, the product of an 1960s affair with his devoted African American nurse, Viola Turner. It is Viola who has been murdered, and her bitter son--Penn's half-brother--who sets in motion the murder case against his father. The resulting investigation exhumes dangerous ghosts from Mississippi's violent past. In some way that Penn cannot fathom, Viola Turner was a nexus point between his father and the Double Eagles, a savage splinter cell of the KKK. More troubling still, the long-buried secrets shared by Dr. Cage and the former Klansmen may hold the key to the most devastating assassinations of the 1960s. The surviving Double Eagles will stop at nothing to keep their past crimes buried, and with the help of some of the most influential men in the state, they seek to ensure that Dr. Cage either takes the fall for them, or takes his secrets to an early grave. Tom Cage's murder trial sets a terrible clock in motion, and unless Penn can pierce the veil of the past and exonerate his father, his family will be destroyed. Unable to trust anyone around him--not even his own mother--Penn joins forces with Serenity Butler, a famous young black author who has come to Natchez to write about his father's case. Together, Penn and Serenity--a former soldier--battle to crack the Double Eagles and discover the secret history of the Cage family and the South itself, a desperate move that risks the only thing they have left to gamble: their lives. Mississippi Blood is the enthralling conclusion to a breathtaking trilogy seven years in the making--one that has kept readers on the edge of their seats.

Millionaire welfare queens? Tort lawyers run amok? A $330,000 outhouse, paid for with your tax dollars? John Stossel says, \"Give me a break.\" When he hit the airwaves thirty years ago, Stossel helped create a whole new category of news, dedicated to protecting and informing consumers. As a crusading reporter, he chased snake-oil peddlers, rip-off artists, and corporate thieves, winning the applause of his peers. But along the way, he noticed that there was something far more troublesome going on: While the networks screamed about the dangers of exploding BIC lighters and coffeepots, worse risks were ignored. And while reporters were teaming up with lawyers and legislators to stick it to big business, they seldom reported the ways the free market made life better. In Give Me a Break, Stossel explains how ambitious bureaucrats, intellectually lazy reporters, and greedy lawyers make your life worse even as they claim to protect your interests. Taking on such sacred cows as the FDA, the War on Drugs, and scaremongering environmental activists -- and backing up his trademark irreverence with careful reasoning and research -- he shows how the problems that government tries and fails to fix can be solved better by the extraordinary power of the free market.

At forty, with her career in ruins, she finds herself stranded with a fisherman she doesn't love and two kids whose dead mother she can never replace. Her days have fallen into domestic tedium and social isolation. Her nights are a blur of vodka and pointless loitering in cyberspace.

In all the jungle there is none so great.' Tarzan first came swinging through the jungle in the pages of a pulp-fiction magazine in 1912, and subsequently in the novel that went on to spawn numerous film and other adaptations. The infant Tarzan is orphaned after his parents are marooned and killed on the coast of West Africa. Adopted by an ape-mother, Tarzan grows up to become a model of physical strength and natural prowess, and eventually leader of his tribe. When he encounters a group of white Europeans, and rescues Jane Porter from a marauding ape, he finds love, and must choose between the values of civilization and the jungle. The Tarzan of popular imagination bears only limited resemblance to Edgar Rice Burroughs's creation, and the complex backdrop of colonial appropriation, literary heritage, and nostalgic yearning from which he emerged. This edition considers these contexts, as well as the enduring appeal of the King of the Apes.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780199542888"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0199542880"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 271, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 64, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.2.0.preview.2", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P3yopDDG4qYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P3yopDDG4qYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=P3yopDDG4qYC&dq=isbn:0199542880&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=P3yopDDG4qYC&dq=isbn:0199542880&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Tarzan_of_the_Apes.html?hl=&id=P3yopDDG4qYC", "isbn": "0199542880"}

When war is declared and the outside world intrudes, the twin scourges of religion and nationalism lead to forced marches and massacres, and the peaceful fabric of life is destroyed. Birds Without Wings is a novel about the personal and political costs of war, and about love: between men and women; between friends; between those who are driven to be enemies; and between Philothei, a Christian girl of legendary beauty, and Ibrahim the Goatherd, who has courted her since infancy.

Though ruled by British overlords, the Chinese of colonial Malaya still cling to ancient customs. And in the sleepy port town of Malacca, ghosts and superstitions abound. Li Lan, the daughter of a genteel but bankrupt family, has few prospects. But fate intervenes when she receives an unusual proposal from the wealthy and powerful Lim family. They want her to become a ghost bride for the family's only son, who recently died under mysterious circumstances. Rarely practiced, traditional ghost marriages are used to placate restless spirits. Such a union would guarantee Li Lan a home for the rest of her days, but at a terrible price. After an ominous visit to the opulent Lim mansion, Li Lan finds herself haunted not only by her ghostly would-be suitor, but also by her desire for the Lims' handsome new heir, Tian Bai. Night after night, she is drawn into the shadowy parallel world of the Chinese afterlife, with its ghost cities, paper funeral offerings, vengeful spirits, and monstrous bureaucracy\u2014including the mysterious Er Lang, a charming but unpredictable guardian spirit. Li Lan must uncover the Lim family's darkest secrets\u2014and the truth about her own family\u2014before she is trapped in this ghostly world forever.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062227327"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062227324"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 56, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FU7LMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FU7LMgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=FU7LMgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062227327&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=FU7LMgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062227327&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ghost_Bride.html?hl=&id=FU7LMgEACAAJ", "isbn": "0062227327"}

Tolkien, Wicked is a richly woven tale that takes us to the other, darker side of the rainbow as novelist Gregory Maguire chronicles the Wicked Witch of the West's odyssey through the complex world of Oz -- where people call you wicked if you tell the truth. Years before Dorothy and her dog crash-land, another little girl makes her presence known in Oz. This girl, Elphaba, is born with emerald-green skin -- no easy burden in a land as mean and poor as Oz, where superstition and magic are not strong enough to explain or to overcome the natural disasters of flood and famine. But Elphaba is smart, and by the time she enters the university in Shiz, she becomes a member of a charmed circle of Oz' most promising young citizens. Elphaba's Oz is no utopia. The Wizard's secret police are everywhere. Animals -- those creatures with voices, souls and minds -- are threatened with exile. Young Elphaba, green and wild and misunderstood, is determined to protect the Animals -- even it means combating the mysterious Wizard, even if it means risking her single chance at romance. Even wiser in guilt and sorrow, she can find herself grateful when the world declares her a witch. And she can even make herself glad for that young girl from Kansas. In Wicked, Gregory Maguire has taken the largely unknown world of Oz and populated it with the power of his own imagination. Fast-paced, fantastically real and supremely entertaining, this is a novel of vision and re-vision. Oz never will be the same again.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060391448"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060391447"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 524, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXb0rS2eHi8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXb0rS2eHi8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=HXb0rS2eHi8C&dq=isbn:0060391448&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=HXb0rS2eHi8C&dq=isbn:0060391448&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Wicked.html?hl=&id=HXb0rS2eHi8C", "isbn": "0060391448"}

Whether we are reading about civil war in Algeria or Afghanistan, the struggle for the soul of Turkey, or political turmoil in Pakistan or Malaysia, the Islamic context permeates all these situations.Yet who really understands the central tenets of this faith, or why so many people around the world have turned to 'fundamentalism'? Karen Armstrong's elegant and concise book traces how Islam grew from the other religions of the book, Judaism and Christianity; introduces us to the character of Muhammed; and demonstrates that for much of its history, the religion has been a force for enlightenment that promoted liberties for women and allowed the arts and sciences to flourish. Islam shows how this progressive legacy is today often set aside as the faith struggles to come to terms with the economic and political weakness of most of its believers and with the forces of modernity itself.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "029764372X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780297643722"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 189, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Islam"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 15, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TLiwQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TLiwQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=TLiwQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:029764372X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=TLiwQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:029764372X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Islam.html?hl=&id=TLiwQgAACAAJ", "isbn": "029764372X"}

The publishers call it a miracle-- not too strong a word for a book that offers something for everyone: gusto, humor, pathos, information, romance, insight, style. It is vicarious living with one of the happiest and most admirable of people, a veterinary surgeon in the Yorkshire dales who can write superlatively well.\" James, the miracle worker, has done it again. All Things Bright and Beautiful is precisely the warm and joyful sequel that readers all over America have been asking for. James is now married, and he and Helen live on the top floor of Skeldale House, while his former boss, now partner, Siegfried lives downstairs with Siegfried's brother Tristan. James continues the rich and rewarding day-to-day life of a small-town veterinarian, and we journey with him across the dales meeting a whole new cast of unforgettable characters-- humans, dogs, horses, lambs, parakeets-- all of them drawn with the same infinite fascination, affection, and insight that have made Herriot one of the most beloved authors of our time.

Harry Bosch is California's newest private investigator. He doesn't advertise, he doesn't have an office, and he's picky about who he works for, but it doesn't matter. His chops from thirty years with the LAPD speak for themselves. Soon one of Southern California's biggest moguls comes calling. The reclusive billionaire is nearing the end of his life and is haunted by one regret. When he was young, he had a relationship with a Mexican girl, his great love. But soon after becoming pregnant, she disappeared. Did she have the baby? And if so, what happened to it? Desperate to know whether he has an heir, the dying magnate hires Bosch, the only person he can trust. With such a vast fortune at stake, Harry realizes that his mission could be risky not only for himself but for the one he's seeking. But as he begins to uncover the haunting story--and finds uncanny links to his own past--he knows he cannot rest until he finds the truth. At the same time, unable to leave cop work behind completely, he volunteers as an investigator for a tiny cash-strapped police department and finds himself tracking a serial rapist who is one of the most baffling and dangerous foes he has ever faced. Swift, unpredictable, and thrilling, The Wrong Side of Goodbye shows that Michael Connelly \"continues to amaze with his consistent skill and sizzle\" (Cleveland Plain Dealer).", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316225940"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316225946"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 41, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ILYIkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ILYIkAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ILYIkAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316225940&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ILYIkAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316225940&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Wrong_Side_of_Goodbye.html?hl=&id=ILYIkAEACAAJ", "isbn": "0316225940"}

{"title": "Don Quixote", "authors": ["Miguel de Cervantes", "Edith Grossman"], "publisher": "Harper Collins", "publishedDate": "2003-10-21", "description": "Edith Grossman's definitive English translation of the Spanish masterpiece. Widely regarded as the world's first modern novel, and one of the funniest and most tragic books ever written, Don Quixote chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote of La Mancha and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. Unless you read Spanish, you've never read Don Quixote. \"Though there have been many valuable English translations of Don Quixote, I would commend Edith Grossman's version for the extraordinarily high quality of her prose. The Knight and Sancho are so eloquently rendered by Grossman that the vitality of their characterization is more clearly conveyed than ever before. There is also an astonishing contextualization of Don Quixote and Sancho in Grossman's translation that I believe has not been achieved before. The spiritual atmosphere of a Spain already in steep decline can be felt throughout, thanks to her heightened quality of diction. Grossman might be called the Glenn Gould of translators, because she, too, articulates every note. Reading her amazing mode of finding equivalents in English for Cervantes's darkening vision is an entrance into a further understanding of why this great book contains within itself all the novels that have followed in its sublime wake.\" From the Introduction by Harold Bloom Miguel de Cervantes was born on September 29, 1547, in Alcala de Henares, Spain. At twenty-three he enlisted in the Spanish militia and in 1571 fought against the Turks in the battle of Lepanto, where a gunshot wound permanently crippled his left hand. He spent four more years at sea and then another five as a slave after being captured by Barbary pirates. Ransomed by his family, he returned to Madrid but his disability hampered him; it was in debtor's prison that he began to write Don Quixote. Cervantes wrote many other works, including poems and plays, but he remains best known as the author of Don Quixote. He died on April 23, 1616.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060188702"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060188707"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 976, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 107, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V2-ChsYrvloC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V2-ChsYrvloC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=V2-ChsYrvloC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0060188707&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=V2-ChsYrvloC&dq=isbn:0060188707&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Don_Quixote.html?hl=&id=V2-ChsYrvloC", "isbn": "0060188707"}

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

Nobel laureate, international financier, and philanthropist Peter Novak - a billionaire who has committed his life and fortune to fostering democracy around the world through his Liberty Foundation - has been captured by the forces led by the near-mythical terrorist known as The Caliph. Holding Novak in a near impenetrable fortress, The Caliph has refused to negotiate for his release, planning instead to brutally execute Novak in a matter of days. Running out of time and hope, Novak's people turn to a man with a long history of defeating impossible odds: Paul Janson. For decades, Janson was an operative and assassin whose skills and exploits made him a legend in the notorious U.S. covert agency Consular Operatations. No longer able to live with the brutality, bloodshed, and personal loss that marked his career, Janson has retired from the field and nothing could lure him back. Nothing except Peter Novak, a man who once saved Janson's life when everyone else was powerless to help. With the considerable resources of The Liberty Foundation at his disposal, Janson hastily assembles a crack extraction team, setting in motion an ingenious rescue operation. But the operation goes horribly wrong and Janson is marked for death, the target of a \"beyond salvage\" order issued from the highest level of the government. Now he is running for his life, pursued by Jessica Kincaid, a young agent of astonishing ability who - as a student of Janson's own lethal arsenal of tactics and techniques - can anticipate and counter his every move. To survive, Janson must outrace a conspiracy that has gone beyond the control of its originators. To win, he must counter it with a conspiracy of his own. With mere days, perhaps only hours, remaining, and shadowed by a secret that links Janson's violent life with that of the visionary peacemaker Peter Novak, Janson's only hope is to uncover the nearly unimaginable truth behind these events - a truth that has the power to foment wars, topple governments, and change the very course of history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0312253486"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780312253486"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 542, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.7.2.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m4HzO9Fm6hoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m4HzO9Fm6hoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=m4HzO9Fm6hoC&pg=PP1&dq=isbn:0312253486&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=m4HzO9Fm6hoC&dq=isbn:0312253486&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Janson_Directive.html?hl=&id=m4HzO9Fm6hoC", "isbn": "0312253486"}

In Speaking in Bones, the forensic anthropologist finds herself drawn into a world of dark secrets and dangerous beliefs, where good and evil blur. Professionally, Temperance Brennan knows exactly what to do--test, analyze, identify. Her personal life is another story. She's at a loss, wondering how to answer police detective Andrew Ryan's marriage proposal. But the matter of matrimony takes a backseat when murder rears its head. Hazel \"Lucky\" Strike--a strident amateur detective who mines the Internet for cold cases--comes to Brennan with a tape recording of an unknown girl being held prisoner and terrorized. Strike is convinced the voice is that of eighteen-year-old Cora Teague, who went missing more than three years earlier. Strike is also certain that the teenager's remains are gathering dust in Temperance Brennan's lab. Brennan has doubts about working with a self-styled websleuth. But when the evidence seems to add up, Brennan's next stop is the treacherous backwoods where the chilling recording (and maybe Cora Teague's bones) were discovered. Her forensic field trip only turns up more disturbing questions--along with gruesome proof of more untimely deaths. While local legends of eerie nocturnal phenomena and sinister satanic cults abound, it's a zealous and secretive religious sect that has Brennan spooked and struggling to separate the saints from the sinners. But there's nothing, including fire and brimstone, that can distract her from digging up the truth and taking down a killer--even as Brennan finds herself in a place where angels fear to tread, devils demand their due, and she may be damned no matter what.

{"title": "The Paying Guests", "authors": ["Sarah Waters"], "publisher": "Virago Press", "publishedDate": "2014", "description": "'There came the splash of water and the rub of heels as Mrs Barber stepped into the tub. After that there was a silence, broken only by the occasional echoey plink of drips from the tap... 'Frances had been picturing her lodgers in purely mercenary terms - as something like two great waddling shillings. But this, she thought, was what it really meant to have paying guests: this odd, unintimate proximity, this rather peeled-back moment, where the only thing between herself and a naked Mrs Barber was a few feet of kitchen and a thin scullery door. An image sprang into her head: that round flesh, crimsoning in the heat.' It is 1922, and London is tense. Ex-servicemen are disillusioned, the out-of-work and the hungry are demanding change. And in South London, in a genteel Camberwell villa, a large silent house now bereft of brothers, husband and even servants, life is about to be transformed, as impoverished widow Mrs Wray and her spinster daughter, Frances, are obliged to take in lodgers. For with the arrival of Lilian and Leonard Barber, a modern young couple of the 'clerk class', the routines of the house will be shaken up in unexpected ways. And as passions mount and frustration gathers, no one can foresee just how far-reaching, and how devastating, the disturbances will be. This is vintage Sarah Waters: beautifully described with excruciating tension, real tenderness, believable characters, and surprises. It is above all a wonderful, compelling story.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0349004587"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780349004587"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 566, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 97, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=URC8ngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=URC8ngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=URC8ngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0349004587&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=URC8ngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0349004587&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Paying_Guests.html?hl=&id=URC8ngEACAAJ", "isbn": "0349004587"}

When a long-lost diary surfaces, it seems the two friends have found the key to the labyrinth - but when a fellow researcher is murdered only hours later, they suddenly find themselves in great danger.

Awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1957, Profiles in Courage -- now reissued in this handsome hardcover edition, featuring a new introduction by Caroline Kennedy, as well as Robert Kennedy's foreword written for the memorial edition of the volume in 1964 -- resounds with timeless lessons on the most cherished of virtues and is a powerful reminder of the strength of the human spirit. It is as Robert Kennedy states in the foreword, \"not just stories of the past but a hook of hope and confidence for the future. What happens to the country, to the world, depends on what we do with what others have left us.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060530626"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060530624"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gY08PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gY08PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gY08PgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060530626&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gY08PgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0060530626&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Profiles_in_Courage.html?hl=&id=gY08PgAACAAJ", "isbn": "0060530626"}
{"title": "Total Control", "authors": ["David Baldacci"], "publisher": "Pan Macmillan", "publishedDate": "2003", "description": "Sidney Archer has the world. A husband she loves. A job at which she excels, and a cherished young daughter. Then, as a plane plummets into the Virginia countryside, everything changes. And suddenly there is no one whom Sidney Archer can trust. Jason Archer is a rising young executive at Triton Global, the world's leading technology conglomerate. Determined to give his family the best of everything, Archer has secretly entered into a deadly game of cat and mouse. He is about to disappear - leaving behind a wife who must sort out his lies from his truths, an aircrash investigation team that wants to know why the plane he was ticketed on suddenly fell from the sky, and a veteran FBI agent who wants to know it all. From Seattle to Washington, D.C., from New Orleans to Maine, the hunt for Jason Archer follows a trail as complex as the world he lived and worked in - a world of enormously powerful computers, a multimillion-dollar takeover deal, titanic financial standoffs, artificial intelligence, and the Internet. With brilliant minds colliding, ruthless men waging battles of intimidation, rainmakers going toe-to-toe with killers, and security specialists making a fortune trying to plug the holes, the startling truth behind Jason Archer's disappearance explodes into a sinister plot with the murder of the country's single most powerful individual. And soon Archer's wife, Sidney, aided by the relentless and sharp-eyed FBI agent Lee Sawyer, will plunge straight into the violence that is leaving behind a trail of dead bodies and shocking, exposed secrets.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "033041965X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780330419659"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 613, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Aircraft accidents"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 26, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.3.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SWN-APg_PCYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SWN-APg_PCYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=SWN-APg_PCYC&dq=isbn:033041965X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=SWN-APg_PCYC&dq=isbn:033041965X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Total_Control.html?hl=&id=SWN-APg_PCYC", "isbn": "033041965X"}
