It is one that I well remember from my own childhood and purchased for my daughter who loves it.\n\nIt is about a king who has trouble with rude mice eating his cheese. He consults his wise men and they suggest cats to chase away the mice. The cats become a nuisance, so the wise men recommend the king bring in dogs to chase the cats away.  The cycle goes on until the mice are finally brought back to chase away the elephants, brought in to chase away the lions that'd chased away the dogs.\n\nThe story ends in compromise and friendship between the mice and the king.  The story also teaches cause and effect relationships.\n\nThe pictures that accompany the story are humorous and memorable.  I was thrilled to discover that it is back in print.

Besides, by the end of \"Great Day for Up\" we get to the point where \"EVERYONE on Earth is up!\" (with one very important and rather ironic exception).\nAs with all of the Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners what you have here is a brief and funny story, where the words are few and easy, there is a catchy rhythm, and the pictures are happy and colorful clues to the text.  These are designed for an even lower age group than the Bright and Early Books that followed \"The Cat in the Hat,\" which was the \"Harry Potter\" of its day when it came to encouraging even pre-schoolers to discover the delights of reading for themselves.  This is not one of the most interesting volumes in the series, but overall these books were a delight.", "summary": "Dr. Seuss let's somebody else draw his book on \"Up\"", "unixReviewTime": 1087776000}

Dr. Seuss has written a book here to can allow you to help your child understand that problem by looking at what \"up\" can mean in different contexts.  The beautiful watercolor and inked outline illustrations by Quentin Blake provide great context for these meanings.\n\"Up! Up!  The sun is getting up.\nThe sun gets up\nso UP with you!\"\nThus, this book begins.  You can see that Dr. Seuss has already connected the idea of the sun rising above the horizon in the east with your rising from your bed.  The book goes on to explore all the things that can rise.  These includes ears on a rabbit, hands, whiskers, and eyes.\nOnce he goes into eyes, he then points out that many living creatures have eyes (including worms, frogs, butterflies, whales, and insects).\nThen, Dr. Seuss returns to \"up\" and gives new meanings.  These include taking something from a lower position to a higher one (like putting your feet up by walking on your hands), throwing things into the air (like balls), guiding things into the air (like kites), climbing (like going up a mountain -- Mt. Dill-ma-dilts in this case), and building mechanisms that can go up (like an elevator or a ferris wheel).\nThen, he returns ingeniously to the original concept of arising from bed:\n\"Wake ever person,\npig and pup,\ntill EVERYONE\non Earth is up!\"\nThen comes the surprise ending that will keep you and your child chuckling for years.\nAt first, you may just think the ending is there simply for humor, but it actually extends your child's understanding of what saying \"up\" means in terms of cause and effect.\nThe book has all of the qualities I look for in an early reader.  The language is simple.  There is a limited vocabulary of short words.  The illustrations tie in clearly to the words.  The story is interesting, humorous, and upbeat.  A child can learn to recognize the key word, up, in just a few readings.\nAfter your child has mastered this wonderful story, I suggest that you encourage your child to use this book to identify synonyms for \"up\" which will extend the value of the book.  For example, you can use \"arise\" or \"rise\" in many of the contexts.  Then you can discuss how a speaker or a writer chooses which word version of a concept to use.\nMay all of your child's learning experiences be UP to the ones available in this book!", "summary": "Explores the Many Meanings of the Word, Up", "unixReviewTime": 982972800}

The next most important industry after oil in the Middle East is carpets. The author, Kremmer, is a journalist who spent a decade travelling around the region, reporting on various events for Australian new agencies of one sort or another. This is his story of his love affair with carpets, which turns into a pretty serious study of their styles, manufacture, sale and trade, and of the significance of these items in Muslim culture. While the oil is irrelevant to Muslims, except in terms of the money it generates, carpets can tell a lot about the heritage of the Muslim world.\n\nFor the most part, this is interesting, and there's a lot to learn about Muslims and carpets. Only towards the end of the book does the author begin to veer into actual politics, and then, of course, he turns out to think that American policy in the Middle East is too agressive (this was late in the Clinton years...one shudders to think what his opinions are now). Thankfully, he at least hates Saddam Hussein and the mullahs who run Iran (journalists typically don't like governments that restrict freedom of the press, regardless of whatever else they do).\n\nThis one proviso aside, there's a lot of intersting material here, and the book is well-written, the characters drawn interestingly, and the settings well-rendered.

Likewise, dealing with those involved in the trade would give insight into the history, economics and culture of those living in this area.

Since most of it was written, and concerns events, before 9/11, when the area was not established in the West's cultural radar as it is today, it gives a view of the region that is uncluttered by hindsight reevaluations.\nKremmer writes of his time in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikstan, Kashmir, and Iran, giving us colorful and non-journalistic slices of life from each region.  He enlivens his writings with vivid character studies of those he met on his travels, from dignitaries like ill-fated Afghan dictator Mohammed Najibullah and legendary guerilla Ahmad Shah Massoud to various carpet dealers Kremmer got to know over his time in the region.  Between these character sketches and Kremmer's anecdotes, he delivers measured doses of regional history and politics, and he imparts a surprising amount of information about his favorite hobby, the Asian carpet.\nThe result is more than just some very entertaining travel writing.  Kremmer's lively and discursive work also functions as an excellent introduction to the Central Asian economy and politics.  Besides being for those who just like to read about travel in interesting foreign parts, The Carpet Wars will also be useful for non-scholars who want to have some idea how movements like the Taliban came to be, but want to take a spoonful of sugar with this medicine.\n(Kremmer's book also taught me that I'll never know enough to bargain effectively for an Asian carpet -- but his rueful and wry work also admits that there is a certain pleasure in being cheated.)", "summary": "Painless Education", "unixReviewTime": 1089244800}

Both extremes can get tiring pretty quickly.\nThe Carpet Wars was exactly in the middle, and it was fascinating. It was extremely informative about the history, politics, religion and, yes, even the carpets of the region from Pakistan to Iran.  Carpets were merely the thread (so to speak) that held the several first-hand accounts of travels to the region.\nKremmer is a master story teller, and very funny.  Sometimes it was hard to tell what was more enjoyable, the story he was telling or the way he was telling it.\nHis accounts of places with which he is very familiar are told in the rich tones of a deep affection.  When he is in a new place, like Isfahan, the account is in the vivid colors of someone seeing something for the first time, creating some of the best travel essays I have ever read.

Gray", "reviewText": "Anyone interested in the fine art of rug weaving, the cultures in which Oriental carpets originate, the geography of ancient trade routes including The Silk Road, the history, economics and politics of the Middle East, and present day travel through the strife-torn region will find immense treasure in Christopher Kremmer's The Carpet Wars.  \"The early Muslims inhabited lands where people were born on carpets, prayed on them, and covered their tombs with them.  For centuries, carpets have been a currency and an export, among the first commodities of a globalized trading system\" writes the author, who has spent ten years in Asia reporting for the Australian press.  He uses Oriental rugs as his motif for writing about his travels in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Tajikistan, Kashmir, and the former Soviet satellite countries of Central Asia.  {Here, this reviewer admits his interest enfolds some bias because of my own travels through the region as a Peace Corps worker in less turbulent times.  Also, I have the good fortune of working in a store where a wide variety of the very finest examples of Oriental carpets are sold.}\n In this book we read that second only to oil, hand made carpets are the region's principal export and were so long before Marco Polo made his famous travels along the Silk Road.  Carpets created by various quarreling factions from the Middle and Near East are the focus for retelling how the fighting clans have damaged the carpet trade, effectively wiping out the middle and upper class of society, and left appalling poverty and misery in its wake.  Kremmer describes how that even in the midst of war and turmoil, a bazaar will spring up during breaks in the fighting and the carpet merchants will quickly resume business as if nothing had happened.  A disappointment for me was that the author omits a description of the many varieties and techniques of rug making; he remains focused on his travels through the Islamic world, giving us the benefit of his first hand witness to the misery.\n Believing that only Allah can create anything perfect, the Muslim carpet makers often will deliberately craft a minor flaw in their handiwork that only a practiced eye might discern.  Also, we learn that many rugs woven by people living under the duress of conflict will reflect their anxieties and turmoil through the symbols of war - airplanes, helicopters, tanks, and guns.  But the rugs also will contain symbols of their makers' traumatic lives not altogether discernible or understood.  Like the great paintings of the Renaissance, these works of art may never be fully comprehended.  It is enough that fortunate owners of hand knotted and woven rugs might appreciate not only their beauty but also how they portray the soulful deeper meaning of the lives of their creators, leaving a legacy for generations to come.  This book is an armchair journey of immense interest.  Highly recommended.\nMore about this reviewer on the www at: [...]", "summary": "An Armchair Journay of Immense Interest", "unixReviewTime": 1071360000}

The early books were traditional police procedurals set in the unique environment and society of the Navajo Reservation.  The crimes that led to murder were relatively small in magnitude: stealing Indian artifacts, robbing a casino, or revenge.  In recent Hillerman books, the crimes have grown in scope to encompass serial killing, international drug smuggling, and theft of billions of dollars worth of natural gas.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  The Sinister Pig seems closer to Ludlum that to early Hillerman.\nA CIA expert on middle eastern oil pipeline technology is murdered while on a freelance investigation for a US Senator in the Four Corners area.  Both Chee and the local FBI agent are quickly frozen out of the investigation by FBI headquarters.  Chee continues to probe for information with help from the retired Leaphorn, \"Cowboy\" Dashee (now a BLM law enforcement officer), and Bernie Manuelito who has joined the US Customs Border Patrol.\nAs in Wailing Wind, Bernie is the pivotal character in the story.  Through her eyes Hillerman shows the reader how the US Government goes about trying to interdict illegal immigration and drug trafficking on the border with Mexico.  It is not pretty.  Chee is as inept as ever in dealing with his romantic interest in Bernie.  While there were genuine obstacles to overcome in Chee's earlier love affairs, his inability to make his true feelings known to Ms Manuelito seems merely callow.\nWe know who the villain of the piece is almost from the outset.  He not only has the CIA agent killed, but arranges to have a young congrssional aide he has impregnated vanish.  Lacking the whodunit element, the reader has only suspense to fuel his interest.\nHillerman's descriptive skill is as sharp as ever and his ear for dialogue as true.  Leaphorn is still Leaphorn.

This time the plot is in part inspired by the continuing scandal over the mismanagement - embezzlement and outright theft may be closer to the point - of funds due to Southwest Indian tribes for oil, gas, and coal taken from their reservations under Federal auspices.  An investigator sent by a powerful Washington, DC, senator to nose around turns up dead with a bullet in his back.  It is Jim Chee's case - or at least as much of the case as the FBI will let him handle - but it is immediately clear that somebody with high connections back in Washington wants the investigation squelched.\nMeanwhile, Jim Chee has something else on his mind.  Bernadette Manuelito, formerly an officer in the Navajo Tribal Police, has taken a new job with the Border Patrol, 200 miles away, just when Chee was working up his resolve to make his personal interest clear to her.  And now Bernie has stumbled on some mysterious goings-on along the Mexican border that might tie in to the unsolved murder back home.\nHillerman departs somewhat from his usual format by writing several chapters from outside the viewpoint of Leaphorn and Chee (and Bernie Manuelito).  Unlike in most Hillerman novels, we very quickly learn who the bad guys are, although a mystery remains until the final chapters as to exactly what they are doing.  In general Hillerman's villains are not especially villainous, their motivations often arising from quite ordinary circumstances that lead them into crimes they never intended.  But in \"The Sinister Pig\" the chief villain is as close to plain evil as Hillerman is ever likely to get.\nOne disappointment: an element which usually sets Hillerman's mystery novels apart from all others is their exploration of the culture and religion of the Navajos and their Indian neighbors, this being integral to the book plot and often crucial to the solution of the mystery at hand.  In the present novel we see almost nothing of this, except for some peripheral matters that only touch upon Jim Chee himself.  Washington powerbrokers are a less engaging group than the people of the Big Rez.\n\"The Sinister Pig\" is not the best of Hillerman, to be sure, and it might be argued that it works primarily as simply being part of a continuing series about characters to whom we have come to feel close over the years.  But a Hillerman book that is not amongst his best work is still a good mystery.  And readers who count Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee as literary friends will want to find what has now happened in their personal lives.\nHillerman's Navajo novels have continuing background stories that develop from novel to novel over time.  Therefore, readers new to Hillerman would be well advised to begin not with this latest novel but back at the beginning of the series, getting to know the characters as their lives evolve.  There's plenty of good reading to be had along the way.", "summary": "Good, but not the best Hillerman", "unixReviewTime": 1052265600}

I'm a pretty dedicated library user as well.\n\nI've long been a fan of the American Southwest.  It is one of my favorite places to visit and vacation.  I've also been aware that Tony Hillerman - a name that any bibliophile should recognize - writes mysteries set in the American Southwest.  So why haven't I read his works before this? Mostly I think it's because I've only recently developed an affection for the mystery/thriller genre.\n\nAlthough sixteenth in a series, I don't get the impression that reading the previous fifteen books in a necessity to enjoy this.  The reader is likely to understand some of the character relationships that have developed over the course of the series, but the story itself seems to be contained within the covers.\n\nBernadette \"Bernie\" Manuelito once worked for the Tribal Police but now is a Border Patrol/Customs Officer.  She quickly develops a reputation for herself and while helping out some stranded border-crossers, she is told that a photo of her has been circulating around Mexico, identifying her as potentially dangerous and someone the criminals might want to be rid of. She becomes a target when she visits an exotic game ranch which was once a station for a gas pipeline.  Unknown to Bernie, but figuring it out when he learns she's become a target, is Sergeant Jim Chee, who is madly in love with Bernie.  The old pipe lines might be in use to smuggle something in to the country. But knowing what is being smuggled and who is the force (and money) behind the operation, is something that brings even more danger to Bernie, Chee, and Joe Leaphorn.\n\nI found this to be pretty standard (and average) mystery/thriller fare. The bad guys were appropriately bad, but they also seemed sort of 'Bond' bad - stereotyped bad guys.  Wealthy, white, powerful, connected.\n\nI found the set-up really interesting and the regular characters pretty believable and worth following for a couple more books at least, but I was disappointed in the 'resolution' of the story.  I'm not real fond of the deus ex machina  ending or the dumb luck/getting out of a jam because of something or someone completely outside of the protagonists control.\n\nAs I say, this was pretty average.  It often felt very dated, not just but how characters were acting, but how they were being portrayed.  I'll read a few more and see how I feel about the series.\n\nLooking for a good book?  <em>The Sinister Pig</em> by Tony Hillerman is a pretty average mystery set in the American Southwest.", "summary": "A rather average mystery.", "unixReviewTime": 1494374400}

Cowboy Dashie and Joe Leaphorn play their usual solid key roles, a rogue pilot/political henchman adds a great deal to the plot, an evil villain gets what he deserves, but the steady and taciturn Jim Chee is instead portrayed as a bumbling idiot, especially when facing his feelings for Manuelito. All the parts of the plot make sense and intersect nicely, the title fits nicely, but unfortunately there is very little authentic Navajo lore to add to the atmosphere. That is usually a highlight in a Hillerman novel, and I missed that. I still would have given the book 4 stars, if it weren't for the really weak \"romance\" between Chee and Manuelito.

She's miserable because she misses Chee, but he had never told her how he felt about her, so she left . . .

Well, not quite.\n\nGetting to the end of this tale, however, is far from a straight line as Hillerman concentrates on one plot point, then another, then another.  It would seem that he heard about how the \"pig\" is used to clean pipelines and decided it would make a good story.  It certainly is the centerpiece of this story.  Oh, that and a hit man who . . .  Mustn't give that away either.\n\nFor all its seeming shortcomings, The Sinister Pig provides bits of Leaphorn and Chee for diehard Hillerman fans to enjoy and descriptions of New Mexico to ponder.

In some ways, I'd agree. It's certainly different, in important respects, from his other mysteries set in the Four Corners region. Primarily, it lacks the anthropological focus that's helped to make Hillerman's mysteries so unique and enjoyable over the years. The Native American cultures, which provide surprising depth to the characters as they negotiate their identities up against their traditions, and which also establish the cosmic setting in which the events of the novel are understood, are only hinted at in the novel. Not even the title is drawn from Native American mythology; it's a term borrowed from the oiling industry. So, there's no doubt that a large part of the formula that has produced Hillerman's success is lacking. That's worth knowing going into the book.\n\nBut that said, I still enjoyed The Sinister Pig, just for different reasons than normal. The book is pretty well-plotted, as is usual for Hillerman. I've really thought that some of the the complaints against the plot I've read (i.e. having a good idea of the who masterminded the crime early on) were oversold, since those elements tend to appear in other Hillerman novels. The Sinister Pig's plot, though not as complex as always, is perfectly sensible and features a fine red herring. Mainly, though, I enjoyed the book because the rest of the series has taught me to admire and care for Hillerman's characters, especially for Jim Chee and Bernie Manuelito here, and The Sinister Pig features important progress for them. That's the main thing that's different about The Sinister Pig. Hillerman has always used anthropology and myth to augment and enrich the mysteries, and that's gotten him his audience. Here, however, he'a a little more traditional, using simple romance, instead, as the special extra ingredient. That switch will leave many Hillerman fans less satisfied with this volume, and The Sinister Pig is also not the place to begin reading Hillerman. But I certainly thought it was fine for a change. I enjoyed it as a solid and light little mystery that also brought about some pleasant developments for two of my favorite characters.", "summary": "Enjoyable...But for Different Reasons than Usual", "unixReviewTime": 1309651200}

He is murdered on Navajo land in the extreme northwestern corner of New Mexico.  Navajo Tribal Policeman (Sargent) Jim Chee is assigned to assist the FBI in the investigation.  In the meantime Bernadette Manualetto has resigned from the tribal police, because she is annoyed with Chee for not pursuing her, and has joined (implausibly) the Border Patrol, and thus is stationed in the extreme southwestern corner of New Mexico, along the Mexican border.  She observes some odd \"goings-on\" on the large private Tuttle Ranch on the border.  That's the setup.\n\nCOMMENTS\nEarlier novels in the series were very \"economical\", with a few well developed characters, and straightforward filler-free stories.  With the previous novel, \"Wailing Wind\", and even more-so with the \"Sinister Pig\". Hillerman is (unfortunately?) entering the mainstream of police mystery novels, with dozens of named characters, most throw-away (i.e., that appear on one or two pages, never to be heard from or of again, with no particular significance to the novel); and complex plots.  The stories are no longer about Native Americans, but rather are about \"white people\" who coincidentally interact somehow with Jim Chee, et al.  The fascinating expositions on Native religion and philosophy is over, except for thin references.  Fortunately, Hillerman is sufficiently talented to keep up with mainstream mystery writers.  But I, for one, miss the earlier character-centric and Native-centric novels.\n\nCAVEATS\nThe novel is unnecessarily confused by two premises:  1) The first is that pipelines were being used in the rip-off of Native American royalties.  That simply makes no sense---the routing of petroleum in pipelines is irrelevant, just as irrelevant as the highways a petroleum tanker truck drives on.  It is in the accounting that any rip-offs of Native American royalties could have taken place.  2) The second premise is a cocaine importation scheme.  It looks like these two storylines were intended to converge, but don't.\n\nOther evidence of rushed, poorly-edited writing, are redundancies, such as the multiply repeated explaination of the functioning of pipeline pigs.\n\nReaders are teased with the promise of a delicious expose of political corruption, then perhaps a scheme by Al Queda to smuggle nuclear weapons into the U.S., but are finally left with a few sleazy druggies.  Certainly, when you start turning over rocks, the slimy creatures you find are not necessarily the ones you were looking for, but, in the final analysis there was no adequate reason for the murder of Slate/Stein.\n\nMoreover, unless I misread the book, the illegal-alien family which Bernie rescued had immigrated on rumors that a copper smelter on the U.S. side of the border would be reopened.  (The fictional smelter closely corresponds to the Hildalgo Smelter, which was closed in 1999.  ironically the company town of Playas was purchased by the U.S. Government for an anti-terrorism training center).  Then the closed smelter is described as being located in Mexico, and is the origin from which \"pigs\" are transported to the Tuttle Ranch on the U.S. side of the border.  Huh?\n\nTHE VERDICT\nA good read in a great series, but unnecessarily confusing.\n\n> Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.", "summary": " The Slimy Pig", "unixReviewTime": 1260576000}

That would be pretty meaningless to us.  Our sinister pig is the story's villain, sinister because he will kill anyone to further his goals, and a pig because, wealthy that he is, he never has enough.\n\nHe is a very safe villain.  Everybody can hate him.  He's a politically correct villain.  Some rich pig who is greedy as can be, and murderous.  What's not to hate?\n\nThis was my first Hillerman story, so I was not at all familiar with any of the characters.  There isn't one character in this story that I feel compelled to read more about.  I'm not rushing to find another Hillerman story.\n\nI didn't read the book.  I listened to the audio book while at work.  I'm always appreciative of someone reading a story to me while I'm stuck at work.  I can't sit behind my desk and read.\n\nThe opening of the book is a shocker.  We are introduced to a nearly retired CIA agent.  He is, apparently, the star of the book.  But no, he's not.  Boom, he's gone.\n\nThe rest of the story has to play out without the main character.  It is one of the oddest structured books I've ever come across.  The first character, the one who dominated the first chapter, is gone.  Bye.  See ya.  Now on to someone else.\n\nAnd there is no star after him.  There is a handful of co-stars.  I'm not used to that.  This is very unique in that regard.  Normally, a story has a star.  This one doesn't.\n\nOne drawback with being read to is that we are dependent on the person reading, and we have to listen to him do all the characters.  I don't understand why they don't have a group of people reading, each taking one character.  I'm tired of hearing the guy say \"He said\" over and over.  I'm even more tired of hearing a male voice portray a female character by changing to a really horrible imitation of a female voice.  Couldn't they hire a woman to read with him?  We hear the guy talk in a higher voice.  It is very poorly done.  What else is he going to do?  He can't make himself sound anything like a woman.\n\nThere is only one interesting character in this story.  He is an employee of the sinister pig.  It falls to him to execute innocent girls.  The story progresses in the most expected way.  I could have written parts of the story line.  It is so obvious.  Is this good guy actually going to murder the girls?  Somehow I doubt it.  Are the good guys going to win in the end?  Yeah, I kind of think they will.\n\nSo that's the lowdown on this book.  The people who rated it five stars were overrating it, and the people who rated it one star were underrating it, and you've just read the most definitive and accurate review you'll find on this website.", "summary": "Predictable but entertaining enough", "unixReviewTime": 1157241600}

It's always a pleasure to meet these three again.\nWe have a powerful businessman/criminal with money, political connections, and evil intentions who won't let anything or anyone stand in his way.  We have a couple of ex-C.I.A. agents, one who is operating incognito and is murdered almost as the book opens, and the other who is working for our amoral rich man.\nThrow all of these characters into a pot and mix them with the search for 40 billion or so dollars of missing royalties never paid to various indigenous tribes, the C.I.A. man's murder, and a drug smuggling plot, and you have a mystery (or perhaps mysteries) that requires the best of Leaphorn's analytical abilities and Chee's intuition to begin to get to the bottom of things.\nWell, that's the plot in a nutshell, and it does make a story well worth reading, but, there is something missing that I have come to anticipate in Hillerman's novels.  In the majority of his previous novels, he included, as an integral part of the plots, information that is not widely known about Navajo, or occasionally Hopi, customs, mythological history, and religious rites.  I always felt that I was getting a cultural education as well as reading a good mystery.  This unique aspect of his previous books was missing here, and I, for one, missed that aspect of his knowledge that he usually shares with us.\nEven with the unique aspect of his writing missing, __THE SINISTER PIG__ is a novel worth reading.", "summary": "A COMPLEX , SUSPENSEFUL PLOT, BUT . . . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1087862400}

Also, Hillerman takes what might be his best shot yet at satirizing the bureaucracy.  There is a great scene where the FBI, New Mexico State Police, Bureau of Land Management, DEA, and representatives of at least two other agencies are disputing jurisdiction and who should show up but Homeland Security, insisting on authority over everything and everybody.\nA last comment: the hardcover edition is riddled with publishing errors, mostly misplaced punctuation.

The novel starts with a preface regarding missing royalties to the Indian Nations as it ties into oil profits and the U.S. government.  While I don't dispute his claims one way or another, Sinister Pig clearly is a vehicle for Hillerman to present his personal viewpoints in a fictional manner and to make the reader really aware of this.\nThe story itself, while good, is missing the magical sense of Navajo country and traditions the readers have come to expect from Hillerman.  Gone are the beautiful descriptions of the four corners area, and the deep culture of the Native Americans.  Instead we find Jim Chee at a mid life crisis, contemplating his life as a bachelor and his love for former Officer Bernie Manuelito.\nJoe Leaphorn is present as well, but his character steps down as a main player to that of the supporting cast.  And while Leaphorn has his momentous 'breakthrough' in the case, his involvement otherwise is minimal.\nHowever, who does step up to the plate is Bernie Manuelito.

Something in regards to drugs, gas and oil pipelines, illegal immigration, the apparent murders of undercover government officials and of course and errant and deviant U.S. government.\nThe novel is pretty fast paced and is a very quick read.

It is another superb novel, and nearly on par with his other works. The Sinister Pig offers many characters familiar to  Hillerman's readers. Jim Chee continues to be a main focus, as does his prospective love interest, Bernadette Manuelito, now a novice customs officer working in southern New Mexico. Manuelito stumbles into trouble, drawing Chee and a host of others into the picture.\nNot the least of these others is the \"legendary\" ex-Captain Joe Leaphorn and his new \"sidekick\" character, Dr. Bourbonet. Several new characters - a Guatemalan exile, a Washington DC attorney and an erstwhile law student -- are particular to this story. Still, they're well-written and compelling, and extend the depth of the story past the usual boundaries of a mystery. As the story develops, the reader will notice a series of evolutionary departures from Hillerman's standard fare.\nForemost among these is the fact that story reads less like a mystery than a suspense novel. While it's true that there is a murder, and it is something of a mystery, the good guys and the bad guys all have their identities and roles out on the table pretty early on in the book. From there, the reader gets to anticipate whether the good guys (Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and a few others) will find and capture the bad guys before they succeed in any of their nefarious plans. Since the reader knows how the pieces fit together before the characters, the story really revolves around the suspense, rather than the \"whodunit\" aspect of the plot.\nAt the same time, some other changes seem to be brewing in Hillerman's writing. First, while Hillerman has always shifted points of view frequently in his stories, it seems like no point of view is particularly dominant in this book. From my recollection, that's a little different than in his earlier writing. Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and three major characters particular to this book all get some time in front of the point-of-view lens. It doesn't hamper the story, but for those used to watching Chee or Leaphorn solve a mystery, it's a little new. The other key difference is that much of this novel takes place off the Navajo reservation that's so familiar to Hillerman readers. While that doesn't hamper the story either, for me it left the novel with a very different feel. Prior works were well-steeped in Navajo (and sometimes Hopi) cultural flavor, and I enjoyed this aspect of his works. That flavor, for me, got largely crowded out by other story elements in this book. It didn't ruin the work, but I did find that I missed that content, and hope he returns to it in the future.\nFar from harming the work, these differences and changes simply present the story in a different light. Sinister Pig is an excellent novel, and well lives up to the expectations that Hillerman's readers have. I give it five stars for it's strong story, good characters and compelling tempo. I don't think readers, whether they've read Hillerman before or not, could be disappointed by this  book.", "summary": "Different, But Still Very Good", "unixReviewTime": 1059004800}

The mystery is obvious (partly because huge chunks of it are told from the villains' perspective), and except for a little bit of magic with maps, Leaphorn and Chee get no chance to show off their detecting brilliance. The setting, in southern New Mexico's \"boot heel\" region, is rendered generically, without the detail for which Hillerman is famous-as though he'd written it from maps and memory. Plot elements never connect, and there are gaps in the police procedure (most notably involving a car, which is missing in one chapter but has been fingerprinted in another chapter, with no mention that I could find of its being discovered).\n\nThe cobbled-together feel of this book, its lack of complexity, and its short length make me suspect that Hillerman's health is failing and that he rushed it to completion while he still could. Hopefully I'm wrong. Regardless, readers of the series this book should save this book for last-it's merely an epilog to a long and honorable series. If you've read all the books, this one is a must read. If you've not, you'll be disappointed.\n\nAnd if I'm right, thanks Tony, for making the effort to give us a parting gift.", "summary": "Series Finale???", "unixReviewTime": 1058227200}

Otherwise, this book is bound to be a disappointment.  The villain is utterly implausible, much of the plot centers in D.C. and Chee and Leaphorn are peripheral to the story. I have to say that I usually enjoy Hillerman for the descriptions of the landscape and insights into Navajo culture as much as the mystery itself.  This time, however, the plot is so implausible and the writing so flat that it detracted from the usual pleasures.  I also have to say, having lived in Washington, DC for the past 12 years, that I found the portions of the book dealing with DC and federal politics completely absurd.  In fact, Mr. Hillerman so misunderstands the DC political game and his villain is painted in such broad strokes that it made me wonder whether his descriptions of Navajo culture are equally bogus and inaccurate.  By the end of the book, I had come to question all his descriptions.\nI also have to agree with all those who criticized the writing in this book.  Many of the scenes read like outlines, particularly in the later chapters.  I've noticed that mystery writers with long established series frequently get lazy with the later books in the series (see Martha Grimes), but I do not understand why the publisher or editor does not insist that sparse scenes be fleshed out and that authors adhere to modicum of versimilitude.  I know that the authors of Hillerman's stature will make money no matter how dreadful the writing but I would think the embarassment factor would kick in.", "summary": "For die hard fans only", "unixReviewTime": 1057708800}

Officer Bernadette Manuelito has forsaken the tribal police for a job in the southern most regions of New Mexico, where she is training on the job to be a border patrol agent.  Although she is still in love with Jim Chee, she sees only hurt and complications in staying so decides to move on and find solace in her work.  Sgt. Chee is much better at police business than he is at expressing the personal stuff in his life, so poor Bernie is under the impression that the attraction she feels is never going to be reciprocated and she needs to get on with her life.\nMeanwhile, back on the res, a body turns up that is causing a lot more than the usual interest by federal agents.  There is no identification on the body but the FBI immediately snatches the case from the local jurisdiction of the tribal police and all inquiries from the locals for progress in the case get a response of \"this isn't your problem.\"  Of course, Jim Chee is even more curious when he starts getting that answer and begins to hunt for information on his own.\nRetired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn gets drawn into the same puzzle of the unidentified dead man by a different route.  As usual, he gives insight based on his considerable years on the force dealing with both criminals and the bureaucracy.\nAnd in a final, bizarre twist, Officer Bernie (200 miles to the south of the reservation) finds a piece of the puzzle that has Jim heading down to the border for a visit and a feeble attempt at talking Bernie into coming home.  Trouble is, Chee, the great problem solver can't untangle his feelings for this beautiful Navajo girl.  Since his past relationships have always ended badly, he has no hope that this young woman just might be his perfect compliment, so unconsciously keeps pushing her away.\nBut, personal relationships aside, the Sinister Pig moves inexorably toward an explosive final solution, tying all the strange coincidences and loose ends into a very nicely wrapped, well planned mystery.\nIt all sounds complicated, but in Hillerman's deft hands, The Sinister Pig becomes completely plausible and thoroughly enjoyable.", "summary": "Sinister Pig is a something of a departure for Hillerman...", "unixReviewTime": 1057708800}

Bernie has seen strange things on the border but when her boss takes her picture and then that picture shows up in drug runners' offices, she knows she is in trouble. She may value her independence, but she knows when she's in over her head and she is. With a little help from Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Chee untangles a mystery that involves a missing $40 billion of Bureau of Indian Affairs royalty money and the U.S./Mexico drug smuggling business. Whether he'll unravel the clues in time to save Bernie is another question.\nTony Hillerman fans will be overjoyed to see a new mystery featuring the wonderful Chee and Leaphorn. Both men are still struggling with their love interests, unable to quite put things together, suddenly inarticulate in the presence of the women they love. THE SINISTER PIG takes the mystery largely off the reservation and so misses out on the Native American culture and religion that provides such a depth to many of Hillerman's earlier Chee and Leaphorn novels.\nHillerman is cynical about the war on drugs, recognizing that its biggest supporters include the smugglers themselves--criminals who would be out of business if drugs were legalized and who are willing to do virtually anything to prevent this disaster. As always in Hillerman novels, the FBI is treated as incompetent and corrupt at the D.C. level, even as it sends its most talented agents into the hinterland. Hillerman also takes a dig at the Department of Homeland Security, recognizing that adding a layer of bureaucracy may not be the best way to improve safety.\nHillerman's strong writing makes this short mystery a page turner.

So why the grousing. Perhaps Hillerman fans expected more fireworks after the two most recent clunkers. Or maybe, with the same cast in place, readers expected Hillerman to continue his exploration and exposition of the cultures of the native peoples of the southwest. But as Hillerman moves his action further south, he leaves much of the Navaho ethos behind, and the distinct customs of a people fade as the writer brings the Sonoran landscape to the foreground. Tellingly it is described as even more vacant, more of a vacuum of living things than the \"Four Corners\" setting of earlier novels. Bernie, now with the Customs Patrol carries extra plastic jugs of water in her vehicle, and she will need them as she discovers thirsty illegals stranded in the desert. Principal characters getting lost because of undistinguishable landmarks ( unthinkable on Navaho land ) leads  more than once to important plot turns.

Chee and Leaphorn have basically nothing to do in this story except pass on endless, awkward exposition. Side characters slide in and out with no real purpose. The only cop who Hillerman seems to be interested in, the fetching Bernie Manuelito, becomes a helpless pawn in a macho boy's game of drugs and power. Even Hillerman's trademark Ansel Adams-esque descriptions of the southwestern scenery seem minimized and irrelevant. Hillerman can't even figure out how to end it properly, resorting to a horridly uncharacteristic \"epilogue\" that seems like it was written two hours before deadline.\nThis series really does have a lot of legs in it, but Hillerman no longer seems to have the energy to keep it moving.

Some familiar characters, a murder and related violence, short chapters, almost continual action and extremely limited character development. (Eliminate the many blank pages between chapters and it is barely two hundred small pages of large type. Thus, it is overpriced.)\nThe story has great potential. It has the well known characters of Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police and Bernie Manuelito, now separated geograpically from Chee as a rookie Border Patrol officer and with the future of their relationship in doubt. When a puzzling murder in Chee's jurisdiction intersects with Bernie's work, the retired \"Legendary Lieutenant \" Joe Leaphorn is called upon for consultation. At the same time there seems to be a puzzling interest emanating from a powerful source in Washington, D.C. concerning the ramifications of the case.\nThere is an intimation that the dead man may have been investigating the actual scandal concerning the loss (probably due to a combination of theft, embezzlement, indifference and incompetence) of billions of dollars of royalties from the Indian Tribal Royalty Fund held in trust by the Department of the Interior. This is a topic with great potential for an author with Hillerman's skills and knowledge, but it becomes peripheral to a pretty standard police procedural combined with the mystery of how the romance between Bernie and Jim will conclude. There is some excellent misdirection regarding both the nature of the underlying crinimal activity and its participants and who or what is the real \"SINISTER PIG\". But a lot of the oppportunities to develop the potential plot complications and resultant suspense were simply never pursued. Also, there were several loose ends that were never satisfactorily tied up despite the attempt to do so in the epilogue. (I cannot go into details without revealing too much of the plot.) It is almost as if Hillerman had an outline for a wonderfully complex story and then decided it was too complicated and so decided to quickly bring this part of the story to a close and leave the rest for a sequel.\nAs the title of my review implies, a few elements helped me decide to generously round up my rating to three stars. First, the plot is clever, and there is sufficient misdirection to keep the reader's interest. Second, it involves familiar characters. Third, this is a incredibly fast read. It is definitely a book for a short trip or a rainy afternoon.

In almost if not every story of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Tony Hillerman has presented his readers with lessons about many facets of the southwestern Native American culture, the problems this culture faces.  This novel is more a straight thriller, without significant overtones of cultural stress and adaptation.  The basic plot line does have a Native American connection.  It seems that the Department of the Interior is responsible for a trust fund for Native Americans.  The trust is where royalties and other payments for oil, gas, timber, and other sales from reservation lands are deposited so that the money can be used for the benefit of the tribes.  It also seems that tens of billions of dollars which should be in the trust are not, and there doesn't seem to be any explanation.  A senator hires a retiring CIA specialist in pipelines to investigate what is happening in the \"four-corners\" territory, especially as it related to activities of a billionaire recluse who may be dabbling in hard drugs as well as petroleum.  The implication is that the billionaire is diverting gas and oil from the pipeline and avoiding paying royalties-or anything else.  The covert investigator is found murdered on the reservation and Jim Chee is the investigating officer.  But the FBI claims jurisdiction, transfers case management to Washington, and then stonewalls.  Chee wonders why the apparent cover-up and keeps on digging.  Enough waves are made that DC people involved in investigating the trust fund situation wonder if there is a connection and ask Joe Leaphorn, now retired, to look into the case.  What follows is a very good thriller, with unlikely \"heroes\" and bad guys getting their just desserts.  The implications of Washington insider conspiracies are raised but never resolved; yet, while not quite up to Hillerman's stories which do have stronger cultural lessons, this is a very good book.

Hillerman has masterfully evolved both of these characters over the past couple of decades, introducing Leaphorn, then Chee, and having them meet at respectful loggerheads and gradually develop a mutual admiration as their respective worlds evolve and change. Hillerman has done this so well that one would think he had everything planned out before he even set the first word to paper lo those many years ago, though that seems impossible. No matter. Hillerman remains unrivaled in his ability to capture the people and culture --- and the nuances of both --- of the American Southwest.\nTHE SINISTER PIG, Hillerman's latest novel, finds Leaphorn adjusting to retirement and life as a widower, while Jim Chee investigates the mysterious death of a stranger on the edge of the Jicarella Apache natural gas field. Though the Navajo Tribal Police have jurisdiction, the FBI quickly moves in and classifies the incident as a hunting accident. Chee, however, is not satisfied. The victim was not dressed for hunting and was stripped of identification. The proximity of his body to the natural gas field indicates that he might have been investigating charges that billions of dollars from the sale of gas have been embezzled from the Indian Tribal royalty trust. But if that was the case, for whom was he conducting the investigation?\nThe stakes become personal for Chee as he finds that photographs taken by Bernie Manuelito may have some bearing on the matter. Manuelito, a former member of Chee's squad and now with the Border Patrol, took the photos in the course of her investigation of suspicious activity around a ranch in southern New Mexico. She is unaware, however, that her photographs tie in with Chee's case and put her in terrible danger from an unexpected source. Chee must rely on his own knowledge, as well as Leaphorn's wise counsel and connections, if he is to resolve the mystery of the dead stranger and save Manuelito's life.\nTHE SINISTER PIG contains all of the elements that Hillerman is known for --- the interplay between Leaphorn and Chee, the strong characterization, and the intimate knowledge of Indian tribal culture and relationships. Chee is a particularly subtle delight here, as he struggles to come to grips with his feelings for Manuelito and his almost painful inability to articulate them.\nThe most significant aspect of THE SINISTER PIG, however, is the villain of the piece who gives this novel its name. A sinister pig is one who has more than he or she can use, but still wants more. The shadowy Rawley Winsor, in this case, is the sinister pig, and he is one of the more interesting adversaries you'll encounter in literature this year. And his assistant, the enigmatic Budge, practically makes the book all by himself. One almost gets the feeling that THE SINISTER PIG could easily have been twice the length of its 224 pages, that the story wants to burst out of its binding with more that could be told. Regardless, THE SINISTER PIG remains a worthy addition to Hillerman's canon.\n  --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub", "summary": "A Worthy Addition to Hillerman's Canon", "unixReviewTime": 1054166400}

This time, it's a mysterious agent whose death extends clues in numerous directions, not the least to the very center of America itself, Washington D.C.\nHillerman's action takes place almost entirely off the Reservation.  The complicated web he has woven involves primarily the drug trade, massive fraud by oil and gas organizations, and the smuggling of illegal aliens across the Mexican border.  Hillerman has chosen to take his socially significant themes to a much broader horizon and readers may feel they're reading from a daily newspaper (lately described as \"America's newest fiction form!\") editorial page.  Still, the issues he present couldn't be more relevant.\nGranted, he takes care of his established characters. The Legendary Joe Leaphorn contributes heavily and Jim Chee faces a complicated and complex set of personal struggles: his relationship with Bernie, his responsibility to his native culture, and his loyalty to his job.  Hillerman has no problem with any of this, yet \"The Sinister Pig\" seems to move at a pace unusually fast for the author.

But still, his books read like they've actually been edited and checked and coddled a bit.\nSinister Pig deals with murder - of course - dum-de-dum-dum: otherwise, it wouldn't be a Hillerman mystery.

I also want the book to be more than 240 pages.

I never for one minute believed the author's reasoning behind Bernadette Mauelito's leaving the Navajo Tribal Police for a job with the Board Patrol.

Be careful not to read reviews that tell too much of the plot, or much of the book's pleasure will be needlessly spoiled for you.  Some will not like this story as much as previous ones because it moves into new ground, both geographically and story-telling-wise.  Having that reaction is like failing to appreciate the latest model of Ferrari while being totally fixated on the 1950s versions.  Be open to the evolution of Mr. Hillerman's skill and the potential of his characters.\nBecause this book relies so much on past character development to establish its story, it would be a major mistake to make this the first book you read in the series.  If you start with this book, the big mystery will be finding out who all of the people are and why the story involves them.  I think this is one of those series where you really should start at the beginning and work on from there.\nThis story is told from the perspective of several different characters, none of whom know everything that is going on.  As the reader, you are privy to more of their thoughts and knowledge than any of them have which helps you anticipate what will happen next.  Yet, until near the end, the ultimate meanings of the book's title will be hidden from you.  It's a nice job of misdirection and a gradual, tasty unpeeling of the story grape.\nNeither Jim Chee nor Joe Leaphorn are the center of this story, although they play major roles.  This is Bernie Manuelito's story although she doesn't appear in the book's opening.  She has left some of her frustrations with Jim Chee and the Navajo Tribal Police to join the U.S. Customs Border Patrol near the border of Arizona and New Mexico.  This takes her 200 miles from the reservation, and she's lonely despite making friends there.  She alternates pining for Jim and being annoyed by his seeming aloofness in letters.  He misses her desperately, but cannot bring himself to do anything about it.  Bernie finds her new job emotionally and physically challenging because it involves both stopping illegal immigrants who may be in trouble after being abandoned by the coyote guides who lead them and dangerous drug smugglers who will stop at nothing to get their valuable, illegal cargoes through.\nIn the background to the story are a mysterious investigation of misappropriation of billions in royalties due to Tribal Trust Funds from oil and gas sales, an unexplained death which the FBI hushes up, a Washington power broker who desperately wants the war on drugs to continue, former CIA agents and operatives, blackmail, a missing mistress, an exotic game ranch, an investigative reporter, and unexplained construction in the middle of nowhere.\nThe book's only flaw is that the villain is portrayed in terms that are a little too extreme to be credible.  He's more like a James Bond foe than a Tony Hillerman criminal.\nThe overall theme of this book is about how our misperceptions of what is going on are likely to lead us astray.  These misperceptions may be based on differences in language and culture, knowing only parts of the facts, having facts be withheld from us, or by assuming what others tell us is true when it is not.  Mr. Hillerman does a masterful job of portraying all of these problems, and showing that it is important that we act on our desire to know more . . . rather than being satisfied with what appears to be going on at the surface.  Better solutions are at hand, if only we grasp them.\nAfter you finish this fine book, I suggest that you think about where you may be misperceiving the potential around you.  How can you test the accuracy and completeness of those perceptions where it's important?\nDonald Mitchell\nCo-author of The 2,000 Percent Solution, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise and The Ultimate Competitive Advantage", "summary": "Bernie Manuelito Tangles with a Corrupt Power Broker", "unixReviewTime": 1053216000}

It hasn't been that long since THE WAILING WIND.\n This one is a very rapid read, with much of the action happening away from the Navajo reservation (Always a bad move, Tony). The plot centers around the murder of a retired CIA operative who's investigating the theft of billions of dollars in Indian oil, gas, coal, and timber royalties for a United States senator.\n Bernie Manuelito has taken a job with the border patrol to get away from Jim Chee, her pushy boss, when she stumbles across a suspicious construction project in the middle of the desert. Unknowingly, she has become embroiled in a smuggling operation and her picture is being spread around by Mexican drug traffickers as a DEA agent to be on the lookout for. Meanwhile, Chee is pining away for Bernie, trying to think of a reason to go get her and ask her to marry him. This is where Joe Leaphorn enters the picture. He gets out his maps and is able to tie the original murder scene to some abandoned oil and gas pipelines leading from Sonora, Mexico, to the site of the murder. The Sinister Pig of the title is a device used to clean the insides of the pipelines. Joe quickly grasps the possibilities.\n Hillerman uses multiple viewpoints to help us follow the action. There's a billionaire drug smuggler, his former CIA pilot (the most interesting character in the book), and a corrupt border patrol supervisor and of course our friends Joe, Jim, and Bernie.\n I'd be surprised if this book is over 70,000 words it reads so fast. I liked a couple of things about it, besides Chee and Leaphorn of course, two of the best characters in the mystery genre: the factual basis of the book, the royalty money which the Department of the Interior lost or stole and the great character, Budge C. de Baca, the billionaire's pilot, a romantic felon I haven't seen anywhere else. I also like Cowboy Dashee, a recurring character in the Leaphorn/Chee series, who is now working for the Bureau of Land Management.

This story, and various versions of it, have been around a long, long time and the message it holds is as pertinent today as it was when this story was first conceived.\n\nWhile Watty Piper in most generally given credit for the writing of this wonderful little book, the story was actually first conceived in 1906 under the title Thinking One Can, and was meant to be a Sunday School Story.  It was later published under the title of The Pony Engine, in 1920.  After morphing through several versions and several titles, it was finally published in 1930 by Watty piper which was a pseudonym for the publisher.  Since that time this little and wonderful story had continued to change in detail and even films have been made.  The message throughout the years though has remained the same.\n\nNow this newest version, the one being reviewed here is indeed different than the original and the story has been snipped and changed here and there and the art work is most certainly different.  Now I am a traditionalist when it comes to such works and normally I would go into a rant at this point in my review.  Not so in this case.  I picked this one up at the library and despite the changes; I found it to be a very well done little book.

Goonan", "reviewText": "I loved this book as a child and I still remember my mother reading it to me vividly to this day.  She has since passed away, however, the underlying message of the book about having confidence in oneself stuck.  I think this theme of \"knowing you can do it\" is a value message for children to learn.\n\nI read through the story of the book and it had even more impact with the updated art.  The images are original, powerful and really bring the story to life.  I can see why they would appeal to children and the use of colors is amazing.\n\nI've read a few reviewers comments that the book is sexist.  I didn't notice that the \"bad trains\" were a certain gender and the \"good trains\" another when I read it.  However, I'm wondering if this just may be a coincidence.  I have a hard time believing the author of a classic like this with such a good underlying positive message would do something like this on purpose.  Ditto... for the editors who are watching out for problems like this.  While I could be wrong, I think Watty Piper deserves the benefit of the doubt and perhaps she will be open to making some editorial changes to correct an apparent sexist slant in future editions.\n\nI also found the large format and prints in this book a value add.  It is also printed on nice paper and lends itself to being used over and over.  This format also makes it good for reading to small groups where the children will need to see the pictures from a distance.\n\nThe toys seemed to be almost alive to me.  The artwork was succesful in giving them some kind of personality.  They seem more than just stuffed animals and I think this quality will appeal and endear them to children.\n\nThe art is so captivating that it almost distracts me from the story.  I have to admit I haven't read the classic version in a long time, but it seems to me there was more repetition of the core message in that version.  If my memory is faulty, I think it would be an improvement to repeat the \"I think I can.... I know I can....\" theme more often.\n\nOverall, I don't think you can go wrong purchasing this classic book.

For this reason alone, it is unfair to compare it to the previous editions. The older editions are illustrated with small, simple, colored line drawings rather than lavish, full-page, full-color paintings.\n\nLong's illustrations are beautiful and, in my opinion, suit the story better than the old ones did. As I child, I was never quite sure if the clown and dolls were toys or people. Long's illustration makes them obviously toys.\n\nLong's illustrations give the different locomotives distinct looks and personalities. The original illustrations for both previous editions of the book have locomotives that are virtually identical, except for being different colors. The passenger engine in Long's illustration is a sleek, streamlined design with an arrogant, sneering expression, while the freight engine is a massive, dark iron, whale-like machine that looms over and peers down at the tiny clown.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the review from the School Library Journal was chosen by Amazon for the Editorial Reviews, above. I'd like to correct some errors - the writer has her facts wrong about the history of this book.\n\nWhat Burg believes to be the original edition of the book is, in fact, the 1954 edition with illustrations by George and Doris Hauman. Although Burg praises the '1930s' look of these illustrations with the green poka-dotted clown, they scream '1950s!'. While most people today are familiar with this version, I think the older illustrations are showing their age, and I believe children today will relate better to Long's paintings. Also, as I have stated above, I believe Long's illustrations help tell the story better.\n\nThe actual 1930s illustrations were colored line drawings by Lois Lenski, and few people today will have seen them. Interestingly, those illustrations show the story taking place in a stark, snow-covered winter landscape.\n\nBurg claims Loren Long's paintings have a '1950s' look. Anyone familiar with painting styles of the 1930s will recognize the influence of painters like Grant Wood on Long's style. Long's illustrations are much truer to the 1930s than the 1954 illustrations are.\n\nI am a friend of Loren Long's, and I know how hard he worked on these illustrations and how much this book meant to him.

We miss that visual poetry. The illustrations are the only visual element and they are nice but not enough to make us enter in this world of childrens poetry, of poetry for children that has to be visually clear and attractive.\n\nThe second characteristic is that it is poetry written for children. Yet it is mostly in first person as if some hypothetical child were speaking and that is not possible because the language is by far too complicated for a child that has just learned how to read. It is thus poetry that has to be read to children and what children are going to find in the poetry is the music with lines, rhymes and rhythm. It is of course a common convention for childrens literature in the second half of the 19th century, which is Stevensons period. Childrens literature is adult literature for children.\n\nThe themes are essentially that of a garden, a vast garden and a vast house, if not mansion in the countryside by the sea. We are in a wealthy family or even more than wealthy, with a nurse for that child who is a boy and cannot be anything else, knowing how often he plays with tin soldiers or he plays soldier himself, even if at the end an allusion to a cousin girl is introduced. The world is seen through the eyes of the boy and described through the pen and language of the adult who is telling us the story. The big Louis author is alluding towards the end he is seeing the world through the eyes of a small Louis boy that he probably used to be.\n\nThen you have a lot of seascape, ships, boats, fishing, travelling and foreign countries, though the dominant one is India but only as a distant somewhere. The child is also imagining fairy countries, dreamlike countries to which he is able to travel. But do not expect any Wonderland.\n\nThe most surprising element is the total solitude of that child. He is alone, playing alone and by himself with toys he can play with alone. He does not have any partner and adults are not taking part in the games. The nurse only puts him to bed and gets him up. In many ways it is a sad vision of a solitary quasi abandoned child in a wealthy family where everyone is minding their own businesses and hardly the child. So he sleeps at night, watches the sun rising in the morning, plays in the garden all day long, watches the sun setting in the evening and goes back to bed at night. That kind of life is traumatic. A child living such a life should develop PTSS by total lack of love, total lack of company, total lack of another child of the same size, except the imaginary one he creates, and that should lead him to a split personality, a perfect soil for schizophrenia later on.\n\nI was even amazed at finding some social Darwinism in one poem:\n\nThe child that is not clean and neat,\nWith lots of toys and things to eat,\nHe is a naughty child, Im sure \nOr else his dear papa is poor.\n\nIn other words, it is the fate of a naughty rich boy or a poor boy. And it is normal if you are poor not to be clean and neat, not to have toys and food. There is no questioning of it and it is equaled to naughtiness for a rich boy. A good boy, meaning rich, is always clean and neat, has plenty of toys and plenty to eat. Just add to this it is the reward for being a good rich boy and social Darwinism is with you. This concepts of good boy and bad boy are constantly present in many poems and one is for me surprisingly European-centered to the point of reaching infantile arrogance:\n\nFOREIGN CHILDREN\n\nLittle Indian, Sioux or Crow,\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\nOh! Dont you wish that you were me?\n\nYou have seen the scarlet trees\nAnd the lions overseas;\nYou have eaten ostrich eggs,\nAnd turned the turtles off their legs.\n\nSuch a life is very fine,\nBut its not so nice as mine:\nYou must often, as you trod,\nHave wearied not to be abroad.\n\nYou have curious things to eat,\nI am fed on proper meat;\nYou must dwell beyond the foam,\nBut I am safe and live at home.\n\nLittle Indian, Sioux or Crow,\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\nOh! Dont you wish that you were me?\n\nHow plain cruel it is to turn turtles off their legs knowing they cannot get back on their legs alone. Just as cruel as making the Indian, the Sioux, the Crow, the Eskimo, the Turk and the Japanese only dream of one thing: be a good white European, rich of course.\n\nDr. Jacques COULARDEAU", "summary": "Slightly pass", "unixReviewTime": 1493596800}

Also, FYI they are skewed toward gun/soldier play.

I am commenting specifically on Tasha Tudor's lovely illustrations of childhood life, so beautifully paired with Robert Louis Stevenson's poetry of childhood.  Together, image and word are a perfect match, and this is a marvelous edition.  I highly recommend it as a gift for any new parent, a special child, or for yourself.\n\nI live with my grandfather, who was born in 1922 and grew up having these poems read to him and then reading them for himself; when he grew up and had children of his own, he read from this book.  They were a little bit \"old-fashioned\" when my grandfather was a boy in the 1920s, but not at all \"dated\" in the way some of them have become.  I am thinking here of \"Foreign Children,\" with its refrain:\n\nLittle Indian, Sioux or Crow,\nLittle frosty Eskimo,\nLittle Turk or Japanee,\nO! don't you wish that you were me?\n\nThere are others in a similar vein, and while I am sure that some will object, I find all of these poems to be utterly lacking in malice or cruelty.  They espouse the ideology of their time, and that was one of Empire.  If you don't want to read the few of these poems that mention race/ethnicity in a way that you don't like, then don't -- or better yet, how about using it as a teachable moment to discuss the ways in which views evolve over time?\n\nThe majority of these poems feel timeless, in that they dwell in the land of childhood imagination.  Just reading \"The Land of Counterpane\" sends me right back to the world of childhood and the hours and hours spent dreaming, creating, imagining.  Likewise, \"The Land of Nod.\"  I know my grandfather feels just the same way, because sometimes when I tuck him in for bed at night we discuss where we plan to travel in our dreams: the Land of Counterpane or the Land of Nod.  Very few things are capable of staying with a person for 80 + years; these poems are some of them.\n\nIf you have children, or know any children you particularly like, I hope you will purchase a copy of this lovely book for them.  It's one of those books that opens a door into another world, and what the child chooses to do once there is up to him or her -- but you can give the key to the door.", "summary": "Tasha Tudor edition is beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1374278400}

Poetry is not my favorite form of literature.  However, Stevenson is one of my best-loved authors, and I have always liked his poetry because, unlike some other poetry that I have read, it makes sense to me.  One of my favorites is \"The Swing\":\nHow do you like to go up in a swing,\nUp in the air so blue?\nOh, I do think it the pleasantest thing\nEver a child can do!\n  Of course, one would buy this edition of A Child's Garden of Verses not only for Stevenson's poetry (this is not a complete version but a newly revised selection) but also for Brian Wildsmith's gorgeous, whimsical illustrations.  Wildsmith, born in 1931 at the mining village of Penistone in Yorkshire, England, has been called one of the greatest living children's book illustrators.  Stevenson's poems perfectly capture the make-believe imagination of childhood.  What child has not pretended at one time or another that his bed is a ship sailing the wide seas?  And Wildsmith's stunning, colorful paintings perfectly capture the joyful childhood innocence of Stevenson's poetry.  While the language may be upper class Victorian England, the appeal is universal.  This would make a wonderful book for a parent to read aloud while the child gazes at the pictures.", "summary": "perfectly captures joyful childhood innocence", "unixReviewTime": 1338336000}
